title: Rohit Sharma and the Nature of Form

Athletes sometimes speak of being "in the zone" -- the tennis ball or cricket ball appears as big as a football, the game unfolds before your eyes, you know what opponents are going to do before they do it, and time itself seems to slow down.  

If such a zone exists, Rohit Sharma is in it.  Since being promoted to opener 2 years ago, he has scored 1462 runs (400 more than the next best), at the frankly ludicrous average of 58.5.  Yes, those numbers are are skewed by Rohit's extraordinary home record, but his recent exploits in Australia and especially in England should quieten any whispers that he's just a flat track bully (and besides, some of the pitches he scored his home runs on were anything but flat -- see for example Chennai 2021).

It's as if he's a completely different player.  As a middle order bat (prior to Oct 2019), Rohit averaged 39.6 at a strike rate of 55.0, with a 100 every 15.7 innings.  This is dead average: across the same dates, batters 3-6 across all teams made 38.5 at sr 51.6 with a 100 every 11.5 innings.

As an opener (Oct 2019 onwards), Rohit averages 58.5 at sr 56.0 with a 100 every 5.4 innings (!!!).  During the same span, the average test opener made 34.9 at sr 46.9 with a 100 every 14.3 innings.  

This shouldn't be happening.  Opening is (statistically) harder than batting in the middle order.  And the quality in depth of test bowling attacks is (undoubtedly) higher today than it was 5 years ago.  What's going on? 

One explanation is that this is just an extended run of outlier results -- natural variance or a lucky streak, call it what you will -- and his scores will soon mean-revert.  I'm not convinced.  While some amount of mean reversion is perhaps inevitable, I think his recent record is a sufficient number of standard deviations above the norm to make it unlikely to be solely the product of chance.  I'll also point out that Rohit has been an extreme outlier as a batter in every other format -- ODIs, FC, T20s -- so my Bayesian prior is that his "expected" test average is more likely to be excellent than mediocre; maybe it's the recent run that is the actual reversion toward his true mean. 

Another popular narrative is that his recent success is all due to mental adjustments.  In this telling, Rohit is a talented white-ball strokeplayer who finally learned to rein in his attacking instincts in order to succeed in test cricket.  

This is hogwash.  First, the stats don't support it: Rohit's strike rate is higher as an opener than it was as a middle order bat.  (Despite the higher degree of difficulty of opening).  Second, it's just inane to think that Rohit Sharma needed 6 years and 27 tests to learn something that is supposedly obvious to armchair observers.  Rohit has played more international and pseudo-international (IPL) cricket than all but a handful of players in the history of the game, against top quality opponents, with a very high degree of personal and team success.  Whatever tactical or technical adjustments armchair critics think he needs to make, I can guarantee you he has already thought of them, tested them, and rejected or implemented them: not just the adjustments themselves, but also the second and third order consequences of those adjustments.  Amateurs (in every field) have no idea just how good professionals are at their job.

A slightly more plausible mental adjustment story is that Rohit's late-career resurgence is all about confidence.  It's plausible because athletes do talk about "relaxed flow" -- the state when they don't have to think about what they're doing, they just do it, naturally and insticintively.  (Note that "nature" and "instinct" here are the products of 1000s of hours of practice).  Perhaps earlier in Rohit's career, he was not relaxed enough; always on the margins of the team, always playing for his spot, often the victim of bad luck with injuries or the requirements of team balance.  But now he is relaxed, thanks to the confidence that stems from his record as an all-time-great ODI opener as well as the most successful IPL captain in history.  And this in turn manifests in his test batting.

I mean, maybe?  It's a plausible story.  But there's no evidence for it whatsoever.  And it isn't really testable in any meaningful sense, so for me, this is just another exercise in psychobabble.  (Note that Rohit himself has never said anything about confidence  or trust; nor has team management.  That's another difference between amateurs and professionals.) 

A more interesting explanation is that Rohit's game is innately more suited to opening than any other position.  There are plenty of players for whom this (or the converse) is true, for reasons of technique, temperament, and tactical choices.  Alastair Cook is a natural opener; Kevin Pietersen is a natural middle-order player.  They're both great players and could obviously "do the job" if pushed down / up the order respectively, but they have positions that suit their game.  Cook plays low-risk cricket, with a solid defence, limited scoring areas, and immense patience.  Pietersen plays a more attacking game, scores rapidly all around the wicket, and aims to take control.  One is attritional, the other aggressive.  

Could it be the case that Rohit is just a natural opener -- and not a natural middle-order player?  It's not obvious to me.  More importantly, it wasn't obvious to the Indian selectors, who picked him in the middle order for many years.  Observationally, Rohit has one of the most adaptable and universal techniques in the Indian squad: solid fundamentals, excellent defense, but also the ability to play every stroke against every type of bowling.  I can't see Kohli or Rahane opening, nor can I see Pujara counter-attacking at #5 -- but I can see Rohit doing both.  (The only other player in the squad with similar ability is KL Rahul, more about whom later).

Most interesting of all is the possibility that form is just a self-fulfilling prophecy.  If you play 100 deliveries from a top bowler, you're likely to be more comfortable on the 100th than on the 1st.  The more you bat, the better you get at batting.  A player who is "out of form" may just be a player who had the bad luck to get out early at the start of a match (or series, or tour), thus depriving them of the chance to become accustomed to the bowling.  Meanwhile a player who is "in form" may just be one who survived long enough to get comfortable, which in turn makes them more likely to survive.  In other words, test batting might be [Lindy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lindy_effect).
