title: Jasprit Bumrah and the Transcendence of Conditions

The biggest irony of the entire Ashwin debate is that India have in their ranks -- for perhaps the first time in their 90-year history as a test-playing nation -- a bowler who is a genuine threat to take wickets in all conditions: Jasprit Bumrah.

Most good bowlers have a plan A and a plan B.  When the conditions favour their style (swing, seam or spin), they are threatening.  When the conditions are against them, they revert to bowling dry; offering control.

Jimmy Anderson is a great example of this.  Since 2008 (when he became a regular in the England team), he has been consistently masterful in English conditions: 4.3 wickets per test in 37 overs bowled, at an average of 23.1, sr 51.1, econ 2.70.  He has been less successful in India: 2.3 wickets per test in 28 overs bowled, at an average of 32.8, sr 73.8, but crucially, an econ of 2.66 -- less, in fact, than his economy rate at home.

Much rarer are bowlers whose plan A is good enough to succeed irrespective of the conditions.  Glenn McGrath averaged 24 in SA, 22 in Aus, 21 in India, 21 in WI, 19 in England, 18 in NZ.   Okay, so SA and Aus have pitches that favour his style of bowling.  Eng and NZ are considered seam bowlers' paradises.  But 21 in India and the West Indies?  That's special.

Similarly, Malcolm Marshall averaged 19 in Eng, 20 at home, 21 in Pak, 23 in Aus and 25 in India.  Muthiah Muralidaran averaged 19 in England, 20 in NZ, 23 in WI, 25 in Pak and 26 in SA.  Shane Warne averaged 22 in Eng, 21 in NZ and 24 in SA.  Others with similar records include Michael Holding, Curtly Ambrose, Pat Cummins, Dale Steyn, Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis.

These bowlers attack all the time.  They rarely bowl dry; they're always looking to take wickets (though the very best of them are parsimonious even while they attack).  And they're good enough to get wickets no matter where they play.  When everything clicks, their performances are legendary: think Marshall in Kanpur, Steyn in Nagpur, Murali at the Oval.

You'll notice that with the exception of two genius wrist spinners, every name on this list is a fast bowler.  I find this oddly gratifying.

Fast bowling is a brutally demanding profession, requiring prodigious amounts of strength, stamina, speed and skill.  It's the hardest of cricket's disciplines.  Fast bowlers regularly play through pain and strife.  It's only right that fast bowlers are also the key to team success and especially to team greatness. 

[There's a great analogy here with the role of tight forwards in rugby union.  Like fast bowlers, union forwards play the most physically demanding roles in their game.  Like fast bowlers, they need courage, endurance and pain tolerance.  Like fast bowlers, they are often perceived -- falsely -- as being less skilled than their more glamorous counterparts in the team.  And like fast bowlers, their contribution is dispositive: as the rugby proverb goes, "forwards win matches, backs decide by how much".]

In Jasprit Bumrah, India have a player who could potentially be their first all-conditions, all-world fast bowler.  Bumrah took 5fers on his first visit to South Africa, England, Australia and the West Indies.  By his 10th test, he was already the leader of India's attack.  He can extract life from the deadest of tracks, anmd regularly conjures up deliveries of outrageous skill.

Best of all from the perspective of cricket aesthetics, Bumrah is a genuinely *subcontinental* fast bowler.  Let me explain.

Most of the great fast bowlers fall into one of two patterns.  There's the tall seamer who extracts disconcerting bounce and cut from a length -- think McGrath, Garner, Ambrose, Cummins.  And there's the skiddy swing bowler who blows you away with speed and movement -- think Steyn, Starc, Waqar.  (The very best could do both, virtually on demand: all hail Malcolm Marshall). You need one of those two -- bounce or speed -- because swing alone rarely suffices; it's too dependent on conditions. 

Bumrah has both these attributes.  But he has them in a particularly subcontinental flavour.

It begins with his wildly unorthodox action: the impossibly short runup, the braced front foot, the double-windmilling arms, the release point at 11 o'clock, the follow through straight down instead of across his body.  Outside the subcontinent, he would probably have had some or all of those coached out of him, and honestly they shouldn't work so well, but work they do.  He's a true fast bowler -- not just in the sense of bowling 140kph, but also in that he hurries batters: the ball comes on to them quicker than they expect.

[At one point I wondered if his unorthodoxy was all he had going for him, but it appears not.  Mystery does not last long in modern test cricket; Bumrah's continuing excellence 4 years into his test career suggests that there's more to his success than mere surprise.]

The next subcontinental thing about Bumrah is his variety.  Perhaps it's the dustbowls he grew up on, where fast bowlers had to work hard to create opportunities; perhaps it's the influence of the IPL, where predictability is the kiss of death.  Bumrah can do it all: attacking the stumps from a length with subtle seam movement each way; conventional and reverse swing; yorkers and bouncers and slower balls.  In this, he reminds me of noone so much as Wasim Akram -- the archetype of the subcontinental fast bowler.

Yet despite his unorthodoxy and his variety, Bumrah never loses his accuracy, and that's what makes him great.  Ball after ball after ball, he gives absolutely nothing away, putting immense pressure on the batter.  Bumrah's wickets are spectacular, but it's his control on non-wicket deliveries that sets him apart. I can't wait to see what he accomplishes next.
