It's easy to focus on first-order statistics: runs scored, wickets taken, batting and bowling averages.  Many of cricket's most famous numbers are of this type: 99.94, 800, 365, 19 for 90, 153 not out, 15921.

But at the highest level of the game, with evenly matched teams, it's often the second-order statistics that determine who wins and who loses: the distribution of overs bowled, the economy rate of your 4th bowler, the number of balls faced by your top 3 irrespective of how much they score.

Why so?  You would think that just adding up individual averages should suffice, and in a way it does.  By definition, a team's total is the total of the runs scored by each individual run-scorer, and a team's wickets are the total of wickets taken by each individual bowler (and occasionally, fielder).  But the crucial point is that individual performances in a given match are not independent variables; they're correlated.

Consider: it's a cliche that having solid openers make it easier for the middle order.  But is that because good opening partnerships tire out the bowlers and wear out the shine?  Or is it because friendly batting conditions benefit both openers and middle order? (in other words, the correlation is not causal, but driven by a common external factor).  Or could it even be that the knowledge of having a strong middle order to follow them makes the openers play better?  

The fact is, cricket is full of these correlations.  If baseball is an individual sport masquerading as a team sport, then cricket is a team sport, masquerading as an individual sport, masquerading as a team sport.  Nowhere is this more evident than in the case of bowling.

They say batters don't win matches; bowlers do.  But even that's incorrect: it would be more correct to say bowling attacks win matches.  Richard Hadlee, for all his genius, won only 22 of the 86 tests he played in.  That's largely because his partners at the other end were abject: Ilford 2nd XIs.  Remember, bowlers choose what to bowl, and batters choose how to respond: specifically, they choose how much risk to take in order to score.  If a batter decides to take zero risk against a particular dangerous bowler, secure in the knowledge that they can score freely off other, lesser bowlers, then there's very little the first bowler can do.

In concrete terms, Hadlee's economy rate was probably boosted by the ineptitude of his bowling companions, but his wicket-taking was probably dampened.  But Hadlee knew this, which is why he was able to bowl a more attacking length than would otherwise be the case.  That suggests another important point: player behaviour is dynamic.  Players can and do change how they play, which is why simplistic models fail to capture the actual nuances of test cricket.  Economists call this general equilibrium, and it's the key to understanding cricket (and much else).

All of which brings us to Ravindra Jadeja.

His first order statistics on this tour appear poor: 6 wicket at an average of 48 across 4 matches.   But his second order statistics are magnificent: 123 overs bowled at an economy of 2.21.

I want to put that economy rate of 2.21 into context.  Most great test bowlers have an economy rate between 2.5 and 3.  An economy rate between 3 and 3.5 is okay; 3.5 to 4 is expensive; and above 4 is basically unbowlable.  

Here are the career economy rates for some of the best and most parsimonious fast bowlers of the modern era:

- Curtly Ambrose 2.30
- Joel Garner 2.47
- Glenn McGrath 2.49
- Imran Khan 2.54
- Richard Hadlee 2.63
- Malcolm Marshall 2.68
- Pat Cummins 2.75 

(Dale Steyn makes up for a profligate economy rate of 3.24 with the scarcely believable strike rate of 42.4; Waqar Younis and Kagiso Rabada are cut from the same cloth).  

And here are the figures for some great spin bowlers:

- Muthiah Muralidaran 2.47
- Shane Warne 2.65
- Anil Kumble 2.69
- Ravichandran Ashwin 2.74
- Rangana Herath 2.80 

Jadeja, over 4 tests played in the most hostile conditions for finger spin imaginable (remember, both teams went with 4 pacers for each of the 4 tests), delivered an economy rate that was better than the best.  And he did it for 123 overs: that's 20% of all overs bowled by India in the series.

What did this achieve for the Indian team?  Incredible control in the field.

Jadeja's ability to dry up the runs from one end allowed India's fast bowlers to attack all out at the other end: both in terms of line and length, but more importantly in terms of fielding (catching) positions.  This meant that batters had no choice but to take risks in order to score; there were no easy singles to be had from defensive field settings.  (As an illustration: Mohammed Siraj had an economy rate of 2.85 and a strike rate of 62.0 on the Australia tour; in England those numbers were 3.39 and 54.3 respectively.  That's a meaningful difference.)

Jadeja's volume and consistency (15 overs per innings, in a 5-bowler attack) meant that India's fast bowlers had fewer overs to cover between them, which in turn meant that they didn't need to hold back; they could each bowl short, sharp spells aimed at getting wickets.  Shami, Bumrah and Siraj are all extremely attacking bowlers, so this suited their game.  

Jadeja's volume also meant that Anderson and Robinson had to bowl significantly more overs than any of India's pacers over the course of 4 tests, despite the final innings washout at Trent Bridge.  This cumulative workload was beginning to tell by the second innings at the Oval, and I suspect would have been even more pronounced had a 5th test been played.  (There's nothing like a full-length test series to really reveal a team's strength and depth).

Jadeja's utility was especially pronounced in the middle overs of each innings: the pitch has died down, the ball has lost its shine but hasn't started reversing, and the new ball is still far away.  These are the sessions that well-set batting teams can run away with, when bowlers toil and tire.  Jadeja ate up those overs.

None of these show up in Jadeja's bowling average, strike rate, or wickets column.  But they do show up in his colleagues' figures.  And they show up in the most important stat of all: his team's win-loss record.  When Jadeja plays, India are 36-9-11.  When he doesn't, India are 13-13-6 (considering all matches since his debut in 2012).  And this is not solely due to Jadeja being preferentially selected in favourable home conditions; the corresponding numbers for away tests are 10-8-5 (with Jadeja) and 8-12-6 (without) -- a bump in win rate from from 31% to 43%. That's a special player.
