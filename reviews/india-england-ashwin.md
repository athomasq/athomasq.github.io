When is it reasonable to select an average seam bowler over an excellent spin bowler?

If the pitch is likely to offer even a smidgen of help for spin, and you have a top-class spinner, then you should probably select them.  But if the pitch is utterly unhelpful for spin, then it's perfectably reasonable to select even an average seamer over an exceptional spinner. 

As it happens, India have two exceptional spin bowlers, Ashwin and Jadeja.  England have none.  *And England know this*.

This is why the pitches were the way they were.  The English curators didn't want the contest to devolve into spin against spin, even on fifth days; so they prepared lush green surfaces, not too bouncy, that would benefit their long roster of medium pace swing and seam exponents.  India have those as well, but it's a more equal battle than Leach and Ali against Ashwin and Jadeja.

[To be clear: England were perfectly within their rights to do this.  India does exactly the same during their home series: prepare pitches to diminish their opponents' strengths (typically, seam) and magnify their own (typically, spin).  Earlier this year when England toured India, the Indian spin attack took 67 out of 80 wickets, that too with Jadeja injured.  The pitches were designed to nullify England's pace depth -- not because India doesn't have pacers (they do!) but because India's spinners are far better than England's.  When India toured England this summer, the favour was returned: this time, the Indian pace attack took 61 out of 67 wickets to fall to bowlers.]	


Given the pitches on offer in England, the Indian team management faced a genuine dilemma -- in the classical sense of a choice between two perfectly reasonable, equally valid alternatives.  4 seamers + Jadeja, or 3 seamers + Jadeja + Ashwin.  (India's seam bowlers are largely inept with the bat -- Shardul's outlier test statistics notwithstanding -- which means that 4 seamers + Ashwin is not a credible choice).  (Again, intentional: England *wanted* India to be faced with a difficult choice, game after game).

Previous Indian teams would probably have gone with 3 seamers + 1 spinner or even 2 seamers + 2 spinners: this is the conservative choice, the respectable choice.  If it works, great.  If it doesn't work -- and it usually doesn't -- well, there's a ready-made excuse at hand: we have great spinners, but they were defeated by the spin-unfriendly conditions; wait till we play you at home.  This has the additional advantage of self-righteousness: a moral victory to compensate for the actual physical loss.  But it's a cop-out.  By not selecting an XI suited to the conditions, the team neatly sidesteps the fact that they don't actually have players good enough to compete in these conditions.  (Specifically, pace bowlers).

Kohli's (and Shastri's) India team doesn't do this.  They look at unhelpful surfaces, and select players who can compete on those surfaces; if such players turn out to be not good enough, they take it on the chin (and they're not afraid of public censure).  This, more than anything, is why they have been and continue to be so successful.

Which is not to say that their's is the only way!  Picking Ashwin would have been an equally reasonable choice.  But note that I talked about choosing between excellent spinners and average seamers.  In actual fact, the Indian seam attack are all well above average, not just opening bowlers and first change, but all the way down to the bench.  Assuming that Bumrah, Shami and Ishant are top 3 in the pecking order, Ashwin would be competing with Siraj and Yadav, both of whom are very good bowlers.  It's not at all obvious that Ashwin is an upgrade on either of them in English conditions.  For me, this takes a 50-50 choice and makes it closer to 60-40.  The fact that it's still a relatively close 60-40 and not a slam-dunk 80-20 is a tribute to just how damn good Ashwin is.

[Incidentally you see the same pattern, in reverse, in the return fixtures.  Australia, England, South Africa and New Zealand all pick average spinners over very good fast bowlers when visiting India.  India's only home series loss in the last 15 years was when England, for once, had spinners as good as India's (Swann and Panesar in 2012).  The rest of the time, India faced the likes of Dane Piedt, George Linde, Zafar Ansari and Liam Dawson.]
