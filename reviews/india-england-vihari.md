I'll end this series with a note inspired by a player who took no wickets, scored no runs, and indeed didn't feature in the XI for any of India's 4 tests in England.  Yet this very fact is revealing.

First, a question.  What elevates a cricket team from best-in-the-world to all-time-great?

Intuitively, it ought to be some combination of success, longevity, and universality: does the team win most of its matches, over a sustained period of time, against all opposition, and in all conditions.  The concrete instantiation of this is winning both your home and away series against all comers, ideally over at least 2 complete cycles; at least, that's the definition that most of us instinctively reach to.

This is hard.  In fact, it's almost impossible.  In the modern era of test cricket only two teams have done this: the West Indies under Clive Lloyd, Viv Richards and Richie Richardson, and then Australia under Mark Taylor, Steve Waugh and Ricky Ponting.  

From 1976 to 1995, the West Indies won 25 of the 36 series they played in.  They drew 9 and lost just 2: a 0-1 loss in a 6-test (!!) series played on flat pitches in India in 1978-79, and a 0-1 loss in a 3-test series in NZ in 1980 (NZ's sole win was by a single wicket).  WI subsequently won in both those countries, and everywhere else to boot.  

Their secret was simple: a seemingly never-ending battery of superb pace bowlers who could take 20 wickets no matter what the conditions: Holding, Roberts, Croft, Garner, Marshall, Bishop, Ambrose and Walsh.  With bowlers like that, it hardly mattered who the batters were, but WI had those as well: Lloyd, Richards, Greenidge, Richardson and Lara.  They finally lost to Australia in 1995: a true changing of the guard.

From 1995 to 2007, Australia won 39 of the 47 series they played in.  They drew just 3, and lost just 5 series in that span.  One was a bizarre tour of Sri Lanka in 1999: Steve Waugh and Jason Gillespie broke their nose and leg respectively during the first test, and the other two tests were rained out.  Another was the famous 2005 Ashes in England.  And 3 series losses were to India away, before they conquered that "final frontier" in 2004.  

This team was built on the presence of two extraordinary bowlers: Glenn McGrath and Shane Warne.  One was a seamer and the other was a spinner, but both had the (rare) ability to simultaneously attack and restrict.  They could each bowl lots of overs, control the scoring, and also pick up boatloads of wickets, and they could do it in all sorts of playing conditions.  One such bowler will win you matches; with two, you're almost invincible.  Warne and McGrath had long and almost perfectly overlapping test careers: making their debuts in 1992 and 1993, and retiring together in 2007.  Not coincidentally, Australia's test dominance came to an end soon after, with away losses to India, South Africa and England in 2008-09.

Why do I bring this up?  Because -- whisper it -- Virat Kohli's India may be the best candidate yet to join those two teams on cricket's Olympus. 

India under Kohli and Shastri have won 17 of their last 20 series, including away series wins in Australia (twice), England, the West Indies and Sri Lanka.  That's a better start than the West Indies during their great run (15 out of 20) or Australia during theirs (also 15 out of 20).  Like WI and Aus in their day, India are close to invincible at home, with 25 match wins against just 2 losses.  And unlike Indian teams of the past, they're highly competitive abroad, with a match win-loss ratio better than 1.  

Tours of South Africa and New Zealand beckon as their own final frontiers; if they can win one or both of those series, and if they can then sustain that level of performance for another few years (both tall orders -- nobody said it would be easy!) then I think they deserve to be spoken of in the same breath as their two great predecessors.

Other teams have tried but failed to scale this peak.  South Africa 2008-17 came closest, with 20 series wins in 28 attempts, but they never won in India, and -- bizarrely -- kept losing to Australia at home.  England actually won in India in 2012, thanks to a superbly balanced team -- Swann, Panesar, Anderson as bowlers, and Cook, Pietersen, Trott as batters -- but they couldn't keep it up.

What about the reigning WTC champions New Zealand, I hear you ask?  Much as I like Kane Williamson's team, there is little evidence to suggest they can defeat strong opposition in unfriendly conditions.  They've lost their most recent away series to each of Australia, South Africa and India (they also lost to the first two of those teams at home).  Meanwhile their series wins have been either against mediocre opposition (WI, Pak, SL), or in conditions that strongly favour their seam-and-swing attack (at home or in England).

India appear to have all the ingredients to reach the summit. A deep set of quality fast bowlers; the two best spinners in world cricket; a solid batting lineup; and in Jasprit Bumrah, a genuine game-breaker. 

Perhaps most telling is their bench strength.  Quantity has a quality that is all its own; you can't build longevity without it.  One of the defining features of the Aus team of the 90s was how many excellent players could not find a place in the XI -- Stuart Law, Adam Voges, Matthew Elliott, Darren Lehmann, Michael Bevan, Stuart McGill.  

India has the same problem of plenty.  Consider just the openers: India can choose between Rohit Sharma (possessor of the highest home average since Bradman); KL Rahul (test centuries outside Asia by Indian openers since 2015: Rahul 4 in 33 innings, everyone else 0 in 72 innings); Shubman Gill (debuted against Cummins, Hazlewood and Starc in Australia, and looked more comfortable than anyone else); Prithvi Shaw (child prodigy with a century on senior debut); and Mayank Agarwal (3 100s including a double in 23 innings, yet he seems 5th in the pecking order.)

Or spare a thought for Hanuma Vihari.  He has a first-class average of 55 (Kohli's is 51.9; Rohit's is 54.6).  When picked, he performs: he topped both runs and averages in the West Indies, did as well as anybody else in the lineup on a collectively poor tour of NZ, fought a courageous rearguard in Sydney that was instrumental to India's series victory in Australia.  And now he can't get a look in.  Some of this is because of India's extremely attacking team selection policy (20 wickets no matter what it takes), but some of it is simply that he's competing with a number of truly exceptional cricketers.  Vihari is very good, but so is the rest of the India team, and dare I say it, so are another half dozen so batters on the fringes of the squad.  These are the casualties of greatness.
