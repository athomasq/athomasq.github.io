title: KL Rahul and the Calibration of Risk

India's test squad has two genuine all-format batters: Rohit Sharma and KL Rahul.  (Virat Kohli, for all his excellence in tests and ODIs, is not in the same class as those two when in comes to T20s.  Rishabh Pant han't yet proved himself in ODIs).  

This is fascinating because Rohit and Rahul are both test openers: not a position where you would expect to see white-ball batters succeed.  Traditionally, test openers (the odd Sehwag and Warner notwithstanding) are meant to be dour, defensive players, there to take the shine off the new ball and set the game up for the more attacking strokeplayers that follow them.  And both Rohit and Rahul are brilliant attacking strokeplayers in the limited-overs formats.  But put them into test whites and they play a completely different game.

This is a choice.  But it's not entirely a choice of their own making.

Good test bowlers are defined, necessarily and sufficiently, by the fact that batsman have to take risks against them to score.  (Bad test bowlers are defined by the fact that batsman can score against them without taking risks.  And truly great test bowlers are defined by the fact that they can consistently dismiss batsmen even when they're not taking risks.)

The fundamental dynamic of batting in test cricket is deciding when and how much risk to take against each delivery, from each bowler, depending also on the conditions and the state of the game.  This is the choice that Rahul and Rohit have had to make in this series and indeed every series, and it's a mark of their quality that they are able to choose a point on the tradeoff curve that seems completely different from what they choose in limited overs cricket.

What's also interesting is how this choice has changed over time.  Rohit's strike rate has decreased with every season he's played as an opener (from 75 to 55 to 42).  Same with Rahul: his strike rate in recent years has been notably lower than in his early career (40-ish versus 60-ish).  Clearly they're taking fewer risks, and accepting the lower rewards that come with that choice.

The same pattern (of declining strike rates) holds for all of India's batters.  Ajinkya Rahane's strike rate was around 50 for most of his career, but in recent years it's been around 40.  Cheteshwar Pujara's slow scoring has been widely commented upon: he used to score at sr 45, but now he scores at sr 30.  Even Virat Kohli, the most attacking of India's batters, has seen his strike rate decline from the 60s mid-decade, to the 40s.  

What's going on?  In a word, bowlers.  But not just in the obvious sense.

The obvious sense is of course that test bowling attacks are of a higher quality now than they have been for decades.  Not just the best attacks, and not just the best bowlers, but up and down the tanks.  When bowlers of the quality of Ollie Robinson, Mohammed Siraj, Kyle Jamieson and James Pattinson come on as second-change, that tells you something.  So it's understandable that top order scoring rates have declined across the board.  (This also explains why none of India's top order have been dropped: the team management recognizes that batting doesn't occur in a vacuum.)

But a subtler point is about the quality of India's own attack.  Here's how it works.

A test match that goes the distance has 450 overs.  If your bowlers need 250 overs to claim 20 opposition wickets, then you have only 200 overs to match the opposition's run tally -- which means you have to score 20% faster than them, which means taking more risks.  But if you're confident that your bowlers can do the job in 200 overs or less, then it's the other way round.  You can actually score 20% slower than the opposition and still win!  (Provided you don't get out, that is).

This is what Rohit and Rahul, and Pujara and Rahane and Kohli, have recognized.  In the last 3 years, India's bowling attack has averaged 23.3 at a strike rate of 49.1 and an economy of 2.8.  In the preceding 3 years, they averaged 25.3 at a strike rate of 53.8, with the same economy.  It may not seem like much, but that's an almost 10% improvement in strike rate across the entire attack: it works out to 40 runs and 16 overs over the course of a 5-day match.  That difference is what has allowed India's top order to bat that much slower.  They don't need to outscore the opposition rate (taking on the concomitant risk), and so they don't.  

Of note: India's top order (1 to 7) scored slower than Australia's in Australia, and England's in England.  India won both series.
