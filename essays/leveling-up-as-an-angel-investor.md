## Leveling Up As an Angel Investor

----

*I've been angel investing, off and on, for close to a decade, but it's only in the last 6 months or so that I've become more intentional and systematic about it.*  

*One aspect of this leveling up is more careful measurement of everything I do; and in the spirit of building in public, I thought I'd share some high-level portfolio stats.*

### Portfolio Goals

My first step in leveling up was being more deliberate about portfolio construction.  I've settled on a framework that fits my risk and return preferences:

Within these companies, I aim to achieve a power-law-ish distribution of outcomes:

### Funnel Stats

Here's what my funnel has looked like over the last 6 months:

These 3 investments join the 7 investments I made in the preceding 2 years, giving me a portfolio of 10 companies (so far).  

Unfortunately, I didn't track my funnel prior to this spring, so I don't know how this has evolved over time.

### Portfolio Composition

Here are a few different ways to slice my portfolio.

By business category:

By geography:

By source:

By founder demographics:

### Portfolio Performance

Here's a table showing markups and IRR by year of investment.  (Markups are based on latest closed rounds.)

So far the distribution of individual-company markups seems to follow a power law reasonably closely:

Of course, it can't be emphasized enough that these numbers are mostly meaningless, given the short timespans involved.
