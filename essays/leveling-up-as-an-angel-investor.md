*A rising tide lifts all boats.*

## Why This Post?

I've been angel investing, off and on, for close to a decade, but it's only in the last 6 months or so that I've become more intentional and systematic about it.  

One aspect of this leveling up is more careful measurement of everything I do; and in the spirit of "building in public", I thought I'd share some high-level portfolio stats.  

I've tried to keep editorial commentary to a minimum; but you can read an expanded version of this post with commentary <strike>here</strike> when I write it.

## Portfolio Construction

My first step in leveling up was being more deliberate about portfolio construction.  I've settled on a framework that fits my risk and return preferences:

Within these companies, I aim to achieve a power-law-ish distribution of outcomes:

## Funnel Stats

Here's what my funnel looked like over the last 6 months:

These 3 investments join the 7 investments I made in the preceding 2 years, giving me a portfolio of 10 companies (so far).  

Unfortunately, I didn't track my funnel prior to this spring, so I don't know how this has evolved over time.

## Portfolio Composition

Here are a few different ways to slice my portfolio.

By business category:

By geography:

By source:

By founder demographics:

## Portfolio Performance

Here's a table showing markups and IRR by year of investment.  (Markups are based on latest closed rounds.)

So far the distribution of markups seems to follow a power law reasonably closely:

Of course, it can't be emphasized enough that these numbers are mostly meaningless, given the short timespans involved.

## Portfolio Notes


#### Company Selection

How did I select my investee companies?  I tried to understand my (intuitive, implicit) preferences by "scoring" my portfolio companies after I committed to invest.  Empirically, it appears that I place the most weight on team quality, market size and macro trends, all of which are non-negotiable for me; slightly less but still significant weight on business model and product/technology; and far less weight on traction and valuation.  


#### Mistakes and Antiportfolio

I don't think I've passed on any startup that's gone on to be super successful, though of course it's early days yet.  This is actually an indictment of my dealflow, which I think is currently my biggest weakness.


#### Post-Investment Support

On average I spend 3-4 hours with each of my portfolio companies every 1-2 months, helping them on various tactical and strategic issues.  The topics which come up most often are go-to-market, narrative creation, recruiting and team structure, and financing strategy.
