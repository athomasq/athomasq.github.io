**STEVE:**  Okay, let's get this thing started.  Who's first up?

**Steve:**  I have a really great company to present.  Widgets.com.  They make and sell widgets on the internet.  Terrific business idea, and the founder will knock your socks off. 

**STEVE:**  Tell me more.

**Steve:**  Well, his name is Steve and he's one of the best founders I've ever met.  Really solid resume.  Undergrad at Steveford, worked as a PM at Stoogle and traded derivatives at Stoldman.  Killed it wherever he went.  In between he played professional tic-tac-toe in France and wrote a book about heli-skiing in Tahiti.  What a life story.

**STEVE:**  Wow.

**Steve:**  This is actually his second startup; the first one raised a bunch of cash before failing, and he has some great lessons to share from it.  Amazing presence and confidence, super ambitious, this is a guy who was born to succeed.

**Stephen:**  And the business itself?

**Steve:**  Huge idea, just huge.  Selling widgets on the internet.  The competition is tough and the margins are brutal, but man, what an idea.  Not much traction yet and the product is still early, but that gives us a chance to get in at a decent valuation.

**STEVE:**  I like it.  I like it a lot.  What's he asking for?

**Steve:**  20M on a 60M pre, no board seat.

**Stephen:**  That seems high for no product and no revenue, doesn't it?

**Steve:**  Well, you know, the market sets the price.  And I gotta tell you, this one's likely to be competitive -- Steve just ticks so many boxes.  Lots of interest in this one.  We're only getting a shot because he loves our track record working with other founders named Steve.

**STEVE:**  For a good deal, no price is too high.  Power law outcomes, right?  

**Steve:**  Exactly.  

**Stephen:**  Have we done any reference checks?

**Steve:**  Oh, for sure -- I called Stevie over at Steven Capital.  He loves him.  He wants to co-lead with us if we're up for that.  He said he couldn't remember when he last saw such a great founder.  Candidly, he told me Steve reminds him of Steve Stevens.  That's pretty cool.

**STEVE:**  Okay, I want to do this.  We should make it happen.  Get on it, Steve.

**Steve:**  On it.

----

**STEVE:**  Okay, what's next.

**Stephen:**  I have a deal that's a bit unorthodox, but it could be a doozy.

**STEVE:**  I'm listening.

**Stephen:**  The company is called Acme Corp and they've built a low-cost, high-efficiency solar energy cell.  Order of magnitude better than the current state of the art.  It's based on the founder's own PhD research.  This guy is a legit genius.

**Steve:**  Who's the founder?

**Stephen:**  Well, his name is Bob.  Bob Smith.

**STEVE:**  Hmm.

**Steve:**  Hmm.

**Stephen:**  Pretty inspiring story actually.  Grew up in the middle of nowhere, went to a state school for undergrad, but he impressed the professors so much that they fast-tracked him into the PhD program.

**STEVE:**  At state school, right?

**Stephen:**  Right.  And then he turned down tenure to build a company based on his research.  He's a real missionary.  He's recruited an amazing team, they've already built a whole suite of products, and customers are falling over themselves to sign up.  

**Steve:**  This is a hardware startup, right?  Hardware is tough.

**Stephen:**  Well, it's tough to develop, but in this case that's already done.  They have a product in the market and customers love it.  There's no risk there.

**Steve:**  Still.  Hardware is tough.

**Stephen:**  But widgets.com is hardware.

**Steve:**  Sure, but that's different.  That's an internet model.  And the founder is really something special.  He just projects so much confidence in his ability to make magic happen.

**Stephen:**  But Bob has already solved those hardware challenges!  And he did it on a shoestring budget, too.  

**STEVE:**  Hmm.  Yeah, you know, I really don't like that.  I want someone who can go big or go home.  Shoestring budget doesn't cut it for me.

**Stephen:**  He didn't have a choice. Nobody would fund him.

**STEVE:**  Everybody has a choice, Stephen.  Let's move on. 

----

**Stephen:**  Okay.  You'll like this one.  CHOAM Corp.  They've built an AI that outperforms Stoogle and everyone else.

**Steve:**  I like the sound of that.  

**Stephen:**  They plan to license it to big tech firms, big banks, big manufacturers, you name it.  It's perfectly general AI, the market is huge.  It's the biggest market there is.

**STEVE:** That sounds promising.  Tell me about the founder.

**Stephen:**  He's amazing.  His name is Mike Finch.  

**STEVE:**  Hmm.

**Steve:**  Hmm.

**Stephen:**  First-gen college student.  Got a full-ride scholarship to Steveford, won a bunch of prizes there, then fast-tracked into Stoogle Brain.  Then he did a startup which he sold to Stevacle -- pretty big exit.  He's smart and capable and just flat out knows how to execute.

**Steve:**  Hmm.  Sounds a bit too good to be true.  

**STEVE:**  Was he a diversity admit at Steveford?  

**Stephen:**  I don't think so, everyone I checked said he was the real deal.

**Steve:**  Who did you talk to?

**Stephen:**  Well, I talked to Jim over at Second Ventures -- they funded his first company.  He couldn't stop raving about how good he was.

**STEVE:** *(dismissively)*  Oh, Jim.  Yeah, well, I don't know about that.  They don't really know what it takes to play in the big time. 

**Stephen:**  I also talked to Stevie at Steven Capital.  To be honest he was a bit reserved, thought I'm not quite sure why.  He said he had doubts about Mike's leadership ability.  Couldn't really compare him with any of his founders.

**STEVE:**  Hmm.

**Steve:**  Hmm.

**Stephen:**  Look, he ran a top team at Stoogle and then took his first startup from 0 to 500 people and a big exit, I think he's got leadership ability.

**Steve:**  You can't really coach these things.  Some people just stand out, you know?  I'd trust Stevie on this one.

**Stephen:**  Well, let's talk about the business.  It's an absolutely huge market, the product is totally unique, there's clear customer demand, and really great defensibility.

**Steve:**  It's a software business, right?

**Stephen:**  Yep.  

**STEVE:**  Hmm.

**Stephen:**  But we love software!  The structural economics are insanely good. 

**STEVE:**  I wonder if we should take a contrarian line on this.  Everyone's funding software businesses.  Maybe the right move is to double down on hardware like widgets.com.

**Stephen:**  Shouldn't we just invest in the best companies?  Irrespective of hardware or software: just look at the market and the product and the economics.

**STEVE:**  Yeah, okay, I hear you, but a good market and a good product don't matter if the team isn't good.  VC is a people business, first and foremost.  I'm a bit concerned about this Mike person.  I don't know if he can cut it.

**Steve:**  I don't see any accounting experience on his resume, do you think he'll be able to manage a budget?

**STEVE:**  He might be technically adept, but can he sell?

**Steve:**  He might have customer traction, but is the product technically sound?

**STEVE:**  I don't know if I buy the macro thesis around AI.

**Steve:**  Hmm, I'm looking at their data room and it looks like their NRR is only +155%, that's not as good at Steveflake you know.  I don't think we should be investing in companies that are not best-in-class.

**STEVE:**  Do you think he'll be able to attract a top team?

**Steve:**  Or later stage investors, that's important too.  I don't know if they'll want to invest in somebody who isn't out of the top drawer.

**STEVE:**  Zooming out, I see Stevetech, Stoogle, startup -- it's all a bit careerist.  Too one-dimensional for me.  Not sure I see a spark there.

**Steve:**  Stevie mentioned a possible lack of charisma.  Mike is no Steve, that's for sure.

**STEVE:**  Yeah, I don't think we can make this one work.

**Stephen:**  But ... 

**STEVE:**  So, we're agreed.  We'll offer terms at 20M on 60M for our guy Steve at Widgets.com.

*The meeting ends.*

*Later that day...*

**Stephen:**  Can you help me think through our IC decision today?  I'm not sure I understood your process and I'd like to double click on it.

**STEVE:** *(affably)*  Of course.  

**Stephen:**  So I'm trying to get a handle on why you wanted to invest in Steve but not Mike.  To me it seemed like Mike was better in almost every respect.  Better tech, better traction, stronger resume, everything.



**STEVE:**  You can't reduce venture investing to just numbers on a scorecard.  Otherwise anybody could do it.  There's a whole lot of intangibles to consider.

**Stephen:** That's precisely what I wanted to double click on.  What intangibles should I be looking for?

leadership, charisma
pattern matching

but it's easy to see char anmd pat in ppl like oure

It's not subkective.  facr the facts.  



**STEVE:**  All that is true, but you have to face the facts.  Empirically, founders named Steve outperform all other founders.  

**Stephen:** But that's because we don't fund anyone else!

**STEVE:**  That's a perfectly rational decision.  We know that most succesful startups are founded by people named Steve.  Look at all the big tech firms -- there's Steve Jobs, Steve Gates, Steve Zuckerberg, Steve Bezos.  I mean, how can you argue with that pattern?

**Stephen:**  But surely this is just a chicken-and-egg problem.  If we funded more non-Steves, then you'd see more tech leaders not named Steve, and so the perception that only Steves can be leaders would erode.

**STEVE:**  I don't see any empirical evidence for that hypothesis at all.  You have to be more rigorous than that if you want to work in venture.

**Stephen:**  


fiduciary
scorecard
meritocracy / standards
dei
word-changing
stevist, not capable
lps
leadership qulaitu
only the best


diluter standards
pipeline problem
ref check
LP profies
pattern matching
woke, dei, metrics
tokenism




**STEVE:**  Maybe in some ideal world.  But in the world we actually live in, we have a fiduciary duty to maximize LP returns, so we simply cannot fund.  That would be unprofessional and indeed a dereliciton of duty.









I'm all in favour of diversity

But we can't dilute standard.  We have a fiduciary duty to find only the very best startups.




Look at all the best CEOs.  All the best

It's only us in the room so let me be frank.

You know that all our LPs are named Steve as well.  What do you think they would say if we went an investted in someone named Bob, just in otder to hit some artifical diversty standard, and as a result our returns suffered?

So are you saying that people not named Steve aren't as capable?

I'm not a Stevist, but the facts don't lie.



We're in the businss of funding world-changing companies. and historicallt the world has been changed by Steves.  Steve Columbus.  Steve Washington.  Steve Edison.  

People like Mark and Bill and Jeff and --0 what was your guy?  Bob? -- they just dn't have the leadership quality. 



THe other thibng is, we're selective.  We have to be.  We can't inveset in every deal,  Only the best.  So we see 3 great deals







We can deal with some uncertainty if the outcomes are big enough




but what about power law outcomes?

Look, you have to face the facts.  Empirically, founders named Steve outperform all other founders.  

But tgat;s because we don't fund anyone else!

I'm all in favour of diversity

But we can't dilute standard.  We have a fiduciary duty to find only the very best startups.

And statistically, most succesful startups are foudne by Steve.  Look at all the big tech firms -- there's Steve Jobs, Steve Gates, Steve Zuckerberg, Steve Bezos.  I mean, how can you argue with that pattern?
