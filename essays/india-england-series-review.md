### Ravindra Jadeja and the value of control

It's easy to focus on first-order statistics: runs scored, wickets taken, batting and bowling averages.  Many of cricket's most famous numbers are of this type: 99.94, 800, 365, 19 for 90, 153 not out, 15921.

But at the highest level of the game, with evenly matched teams, it's often the second-order statistics that determine who wins and who loses: the distribution of overs bowled, the economy rate of your 4th bowler, the number of balls faced by your top 3 irrespective of how much they score.

Why so?  You would think that just adding up individual averages should suffice, and in a way it does.  By definition, a team's total is the total of the runs scored by each individual run-scorer, and a team's wickets are the total of wickets taken by each individual bowler (and occasionally, fielder).  But the crucial point is that individual performances in a given match are not independent variables; they're correlated.

Consider: it's a cliche that having solid openers make it easier for the middle order.  But is that because good opening partnerships tire out the bowlers and wear out the shine?  Or is it because friendly batting conditions benefit both openers and middle order? (in other words, the correlation is not causal, but driven by a common external factor).  Or could it even be that the knowledge of having a strong middle order to follow them makes the openers play better?  

The fact is, cricket is full of these correlations.  If baseball is an individual sport masquerading as a team sport, then cricket is a team sport, masquerading as an individual sport, masquerading as a team sport.  Nowhere is this more evident than in the case of bowling.

They say batters don't win matches; bowlers do.  But even that's incorrect: it would be more correct to say bowling attacks win matches.  Richard Hadlee, for all his genius, won only 22 of the 86 tests he played in.  That's largely because his partners at the other end were abject: Ilford 2nd XIs.  Remember, bowlers choose what to bowl, and batters choose how to respond: specifically, they choose how much risk to take in order to score.  If a batter decides to take zero risk against a particular dangerous bowler, secure in the knowledge that they can score freely off other, lesser bowlers, then there's very little the first bowler can do.

In concrete terms, Hadlee's economy rate was probably boosted by the ineptitude of his bowling companions, but his wicket-taking was probably dampened.  But Hadlee knew this, which is why he was able to bowl a more attacking length than would otherwise be the case.  That suggests another important point: player behaviour is dynamic.  Players can and do change how they play, which is why simplistic models fail to capture the actual nuances of test cricket.  Economists call this general equilibrium, and it's the key to understanding cricket (and much else).

All of which brings us to Ravindra Jadeja.

His first order statistics on this tour appear poor: 6 wicket at an average of 48 across 4 matches.   But his second order statistics are magnificent: 123 overs bowled at an economy of 2.21.

I want to put that economy rate of 2.21 into context.  Most great test bowlers have an economy rate between 2.5 and 3.  An economy rate between 3 and 3.5 is okay; 3.5 to 4 is expensive; and above 4 is basically unbowlable.  

Here are the career economy rates for some of the best and most parsimonious fast bowlers of the modern era:

- Curtly Ambrose 2.30
- Joel Garner 2.47
- Glenn McGrath 2.49
- Imran Khan 2.54
- Richard Hadlee 2.63
- Malcolm Marshall 2.68
- Pat Cummins 2.75 

(Dale Steyn makes up for a profligate economy rate of 3.24 with the scarcely believable strike rate of 42.4; Waqar Younis and Kagiso Rabada are cut from the same cloth).  

And here are the figures for some great spin bowlers:

- Muthiah Muralidaran 2.47
- Shane Warne 2.65
- Anil Kumble 2.69
- Ravichandran Ashwin 2.74
- Rangana Herath 2.80 

Jadeja, over 4 tests played in the most hostile conditions for finger spin imaginable (remember, both teams went with 4 pacers for each of the 4 tests), delivered an economy rate that was better than the best.  And he did it for 123 overs: that's 20% of all overs bowled by India in the series.

What did this achieve for the Indian team?  Incredible control in the field.

Jadeja's ability to dry up the runs from one end allowed India's fast bowlers to attack all out at the other end: both in terms of line and length, but more importantly in terms of fielding (catching) positions.  This meant that batters had no choice but to take risks in order to score; there were no easy singles to be had from defensive field settings.  (As an illustration: Mohammed Siraj had an economy rate of 2.85 and a strike rate of 62.0 on the Australia tour; in England those numbers were 3.39 and 54.3 respectively.  That's a meaningful difference.)

Jadeja's volume and consistency (15 overs per innings, in a 5-bowler attack) meant that India's fast bowlers had fewer overs to cover between them, which in turn meant that they didn't need to hold back; they could each bowl short, sharp spells aimed at getting wickets.  Shami, Bumrah and Siraj are all extremely attacking bowlers, so this suited their game.  

Jadeja's volume also meant that Anderson and Robinson had to bowl significantly more overs than any of India's pacers over the course of 4 tests, despite the final innings washout at Trent Bridge.  This cumulative workload was beginning to tell by the second innings at the Oval, and I suspect would have been even more pronounced had a 5th test been played.  (There's nothing like a full-length test series to really reveal a team's strength and depth).

Jadeja's utility was especially pronounced in the middle overs of each innings: the pitch has died down, the ball has lost its shine but hasn't started reversing, and the new ball is still far away.  These are the sessions that well-set batting teams can run away with, when bowlers toil and tire.  Jadeja ate up those overs.

None of these show up in Jadeja's bowling average, strike rate, or wickets column.  But they do show up in his colleagues' figures.  And they show up in the most important stat of all: his team's win-loss record.  When Jadeja plays, India are 36-9-11.  When he doesn't, India are 13-13-6 (considering all matches since his debut in 2012).  And this is not solely due to Jadeja being preferentially selected in favourable home conditions; the corresponding numbers for away tests are 10-8-5 (with Jadeja) and 8-12-6 (without) -- a bump in win rate from from 31% to 43%. That's a special player.

### Rohit Sharma and the nature of form


Athletes sometimes speak of being "in the zone" -- the tennis ball or cricket ball appears as big as a football, the game unfolds before your eyes, you know what opponents are going to do before they do it, and time itself seems to slow down.  

If such a zone exists, Rohit Sharma is in it.  Since being promoted to opener 2 years ago, he has scored 1462 runs (400 more than the next best), at the frankly ludicrous average of 58.5.  Yes, those numbers are are skewed by Rohit's extraordinary home record, but his recent exploits in Australia and especially in England should quieten any whispers that he's just a flat track bully (and besides, some of the pitches he scored his home runs on were anything but flat -- see for example Chennai 2021).

It's as if he's a completely different player.  As a middle order bat (prior to Oct 2019), Rohit averaged 39.6 at a strike rate of 55.0, with a 100 every 15.7 innings.  This is dead average: across the same dates, batters 3-6 across all teams made 38.5 at sr 51.6 with a 100 every 11.5 innings.

As an opener (Oct 2019 onwards), Rohit averages 58.5 at sr 56.0 with a 100 every 5.4 innings (!!!).  During the same span, the average test opener made 34.9 at sr 46.9 with a 100 every 14.3 innings.  

This shouldn't be happening.  Opening is (statistically) harder than batting in the middle order.  And the quality in depth of test bowling attacks is (undoubtedly) higher today than it was 5 years ago.  What's going on? 

One explanation is that this is just an extended run of outlier results -- natural variance or a lucky streak, call it what you will -- and his scores will soon mean-revert.  I'm not convinced.  While some amount of mean reversion is perhaps inevitable, I think his recent record is a sufficient number of standard deviations above the norm to make it unlikely to be solely the product of chance.  I'll also point out that Rohit has been an extreme outlier as a batter in every other format -- ODIs, FC, T20s -- so my Bayesian prior is that his "expected" test average is more likely to be excellent than mediocre; maybe it's the recent run that is the actual reversion toward his true mean. 

Another popular narrative is that his recent success is all due to mental adjustments.  In this telling, Rohit is a talented white-ball strokeplayer who finally learned to rein in his attacking instincts in order to succeed in test cricket.  

This is hogwash.  First, the stats don't support it: Rohit's strike rate is higher as an opener than it was as a middle order bat.  (Despite the higher degree of difficulty of opening).  Second, it's just inane to think that Rohit Sharma needed 6 years and 27 tests to learn something that is supposedly obvious to armchair observers.  Rohit has played more international and pseudo-international (IPL) cricket than all but a handful of players in the history of the game, against top quality opponents, with a very high degree of personal and team success.  Whatever tactical or technical adjustments armchair critics think he needs to make, I can guarantee you he has already thought of them, tested them, and rejected or implemented them: not just the adjustments themselves, but also the second and third order consequences of those adjustments.  Amateurs (in every field) have no idea just how good professionals are at their job.

A slightly more plausible mental adjustment story is that Rohit's late-career resurgence is all about confidence.  It's plausible because athletes do talk about "relaxed flow" -- the state when they don't have to think about what they're doing, they just do it, naturally and insticintively.  (Note that "nature" and "instinct" here are the products of 1000s of hours of practice).  Perhaps earlier in Rohit's career, he was not relaxed enough; always on the margins of the team, always playing for his spot, often the victim of bad luck with injuries or the requirements of team balance.  But now he is relaxed, thanks to the confidence that stems from his record as an all-time-great ODI opener as well as the most successful IPL captain in history.  And this in turn manifests in his test batting.

I mean, maybe?  It's a plausible story.  But there's no evidence for it whatsoever.  And it isn't really testable in any meaningful sense, so for me, this is just another exercise in psychobabble.  (Note that Rohit himself has never said anything about confidence  or trust; nor has team management.  That's another difference between amateurs and professionals.) 

A more interesting explanation is that Rohit's game is innately more suited to opening than any other position.  There are plenty of players for whom this (or the converse) is true, for reasons of technique, temperament, and tactical choices.  Alastair Cook is a natural opener; Kevin Pietersen is a natural middle-order player.  They're both great players and could obviously "do the job" if pushed down / up the order respectively, but they have positions that suit their game.  Cook plays low-risk cricket, with a solid defence, limited scoring areas, and immense patience.  Pietersen plays a more attacking game, scores rapidly all around the wicket, and aims to take control.  One is attritional, the other aggressive.  

Could it be the case that Rohit is just a natural opener -- and not a natural middle-order player?  It's not obvious to me.  More importantly, it wasn't obvious to the Indian selectors, who picked him in the middle order for many years.  Observationally, Rohit has one of the most adaptable and universal techniques in the Indian squad: solid fundamentals, excellent defense, but also the ability to play every stroke against every type of bowling.  I can't see Kohli or Rahane opening, nor can I see Pujara counter-attacking at #5 -- but I can see Rohit doing both.  (The only other player in the squad with similar ability is KL Rahul, more about whom later).

Most interesting of all is the possibility that form is just a self-fulfilling prophecy.  If you play 100 deliveries from a top bowler, you're likely to be more comfortable on the 100th than on the 1st.  The more you bat, the better you get at batting.  A player who is "out of form" may just be a player who had the bad luck to get out early at the start of a match (or series, or tour), thus depriving them of the chance to become accustomed to the bowling.  Meanwhile a player who is "in form" may just be one who survived long enough to get comfortable, which in turn makes them more likely to survive.  In other words, test batting might be Lindy.

### KL Rahul and the calibration of risk

India's test squad has two genuine all-format batters: Rohit Sharma and KL Rahul.  (Virat Kohli, for all his excellence in tests and ODIs, is not in the same class as those two when in comes to T20s.  Rishabh Pant han't yet proved himself in ODIs).  

This is fascinating because Rohit and Rahul are both test openers: not a position where you would expect to see white-ball batters succeed.  Traditionally, test openers (the odd Sehwag and Warner notwithstanding) are meant to be dour, defensive players, there to take the shine off the new ball and set the game up for the more attacking strokeplayers that follow them.  And both Rohit and Rahul are brilliant attacking strokeplayers in the limited-overs formats.  But put them into test whites and they play a completely different game.

This is a choice.  But it's not entirely a choice of their own making.

Good test bowlers are defined, necessarily and sufficiently, by the fact that batsman have to take risks against them to score.  (Bad test bowlers are defined by the fact that batsman can score against them without taking risks.  And truly great test bowlers are defined by the fact that they can consistently dismiss batsmen even when they're not taking risks.)

The fundamental dynamic of batting in test cricket is deciding when and how much risk to take against each delivery, from each bowler, depending also on the conditions and the state of the game.  This is the choice that Rahul and Rohit have had to make in this series and indeed every series, and it's a mark of their quality that they are able to choose a point on the tradeoff curve that seems completely different from what they choose in limited overs cricket.

What's also interesting is how this choice has changed over time.  Rohit's strike rate has decreased with every season he's played as an opener (from 75 to 55 to 42).  Same with Rahul: his strike rate in recent years has been notably lower than in his early career (40-ish versus 60-ish).  Clearly they're taking fewer risks, and accepting the lower rewards that come with that choice.

The same pattern (of declining strike rates) holds for all of India's batters.  Ajinkya Rahane's strike rate was around 50 for most of his career, but in recent years it's been around 40.  Cheteshwar Pujara's slow scoring has been widely commented upon: he used to score at sr 45, but now he scores at sr 30.  Even Virat Kohli, the most attacking of India's batters, has seen his strike rate decline from the 60s mid-decade, to the 40s.  

What's going on?  In a word, bowlers.  But not just in the obvious sense.

The obvious sense is of course that test bowling attacks are of a higher quality now than they have been for decades.  Not just the best attacks, and not just the best bowlers, but up and down the tanks.  When bowlers of the quality of Ollie Robinson, Mohammed Siraj, Kyle Jamieson and James Pattinson come on as second-change, that tells you something.  So it's understandable that top order scoring rates have declined across the board.  (This also explains why none of India's top order have been dropped: the team management recognizes that batting doesn't occur in a vacuum.)

But a subtler point is about the quality of India's own attack.  Here's how it works.

A test match that goes the distance has 450 overs.  If your bowlers need 250 overs to claim 20 opposition wickets, then you have only 200 overs to match the opposition's run tally -- which means you have to score 20% faster than them, which means taking more risks.  But if you're confident that your bowlers can do the job in 200 overs or less, then it's the other way round.  You can actually score 20% slower than the opposition and still win!  (Provided you don't get out, that is).

This is what Rohit and Rahul, and Pujara and Rahane and Kohli, have recognized.  In the last 3 years, India's bowling attack has averaged 23.3 at a strike rate of 49.1 and an economy of 2.8.  In the preceding 3 years, they averaged 25.3 at a strike rate of 53.8, with the same economy.  It may not seem like much, but that's an almost 10% improvement in strike rate across the entire attack: it works out to 40 runs and 16 overs over the course of a 5-day match.  That difference is what has allowed India's top order to bat that much slower.  They don't need to outscore the opposition rate (taking on the concomitant risk), and so they don't.  

Of note: India's top order (1 to 7) scored slower than Australia's in Australia, and England's in England.  India won both series.

### Ravichandran Ashwin and the tyranny of conditions

When is it reasonable to select an average seam bowler over an excellent spin bowler?

If the pitch is likely to offer even a smidgen of help for spin, and you have a top-class spinner, then you should probably select him.  But if the pitch is utterly unhelpful for spin, then it's perfectably reasonable to select even an average seamer over an exceptional spinner. 

As it happens, India have two exceptional spin bowlers, Ashwin and Jadeja.  England have none.  *And England know this*.

This is why the pitches were the way they were.  The English curators didn't want the contest to devolve into spin against spin, even on fifth days; so they prepared lush green surfaces, not too bouncy, that would benefit their long roster of medium pace swing and seam exponents.  India have those as well, but it's a more equal battle than Leach and Ali against Ashwin and Jadeja.

[To be clear: England were perfectly within their rights to do this.  India does exactly the same during their home series: prepare pitches to diminish their opponents' strengths (typically, seam) and magnify their own (typically, spin).  Earlier this year when England toured India, the Indian spin attack took 67 out of 80 wickets, that too with Jadeja injured.  The pitches were designed to nullify England's pace depth -- not because India doesn't have pacers (they do!) but because India's spinners are far better than England's.  When India toured England this summer, the favour was returned: this time, the Indian pace attack took 61 out of 67 wickets to fall to bowlers.]	


Given the pitches on offer in England, the Indian team management faced a genuine dilemma -- in the classical sense of a choice between two perfectly reasonable, equally valid alternatives.  4 seamers + Jadeja, or 3 seamers + Jadeja + Ashwin.  (India's seam bowlers are largely inept with the bat -- Shardul's outlier test statistics notwithstanding -- which means that 4 seamers + Ashwin is not a credible choice).  (Again, intentional: England *wanted* India to be faced with a difficult choice, game after game).

Previous Indian teams would probably have gone with 3 seamers + 1 spinner or even 2 seamers + 2 spinners: this is the conservative choice, the respectable choice.  If it works, great.  If it doesn't work -- and it usually doesn't -- well, there's a ready-made excuse at hand: we have great spinners, but they were defeated by the spin-unfriendly conditions; wait till we play you at home.  This has the additional advantage of self-righteousness: a moral victory to compensate for the actual physical loss.  But it's a cop-out.  By not selecting an XI suited to the conditions, the team neatly sidesteps the fact that they don't actually have players good enough to compete in these conditions.  (Specifically, pace bowlers).

Kohli's (and Shastri's) India team doesn't do this.  They look at unhelpful surfaces, and select players who can compete on those surfaces; if such players turn out to be not good enough, they take it on the chin (and they're not afraid of public censure).  This, more than anything, is why they have been and continue to be so successful.

Which is not to say that their's is the only way!  Picking Ashwin would have been an equally reasonable choice.  But note that I talked about choosing between excellent spinners and average seamers.  In actual fact, the Indian seam attack are all well above average, not just opening bowlers and first change, but all the way down to the bench.  Assuming that Bumrah, Shami and Ishant are top 3 in the pecking order, Ashwin would be competing with Siraj and Yadav, both of whom are very good bowlers.  It's not at all obvious that Ashwin is an upgrade on either of them in English conditions.  For me, this takes a 50-50 choice and makes it closer to 60-40.  The fact that it's still a relatively close 60-40 and not a slam-dunk 80-20 is a tribute to just how damn good Ashwin is.

[Incidentally you see the same pattern, in reverse, in the return fixtures.  Australia, England, South Africa and New Zealand all pick average spinners over very good fast bowlers when visiting India.  India's only home series loss in the last 15 years was when England, for once, had spinners as good as India's (Swann and Panesar in 2012).  The rest of the time, India faced the likes of Dane Piedt, George Linde, Zafar Ansari and Liam Dawson.]

### Jasprit Bumrah and the transcendence of conditions

The biggest irony of the entire Ashwin debate is that India have in their ranks -- for perhaps the first time in their 90-year history as a test-playing nation -- a bowler who is a genuine threat to take wickets in all conditions: Jasprit Bumrah.

Most good bowlers have a plan A and a plan B.  When the conditions favour their style (swing, seam or spin), they are threatening  When the conditions are against them, they revert to bowling dry; offering control.

Jimmy Anderson is a great example of this.  Since 2008 (when he became a regular in the England team), he has been consistently masterful in English conditions: 4.3 wickets per test in 37 overs bowled, at an average of 23.1, sr 51.1, econ 2.70.  He has been less successful in India: 2.3 wickets per test in 28 overs bowled, at an average of 32.8, sr 73.8, but crucially, an econ of 2.66 -- less, in fact, than his economy rate at home.

Much rarer are bowlers whose plan A is good enough to succeed irrespective of the conditions.  Glenn McGrath averaged 24 in SA, 22 in Aus, 21 in India, 21 in WI, 19 in England, 18 in NZ.   Okay, so SA and Aus have pitches that favour his style of bowling.  Eng and NZ are considered seam bowlers' paradises.  But 21 in India and the West Indies?  That's special.

Similarly, Malcolm Marshall averaged 19 in Eng, 20 at home, 21 in Pak, 23 in Aus and 25 in India.  Muthiah Muralidaran averaged 19 in England, 20 in NZ, 23 in WI, 25 in Pak and 26 in SA.  Shane Warne averaged 22 in Eng, 21 in NZ and 24 in SA.  Others with similar records include Michael Holding, Curtly Ambrose, Pat Cummins, Dale Steyn, Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis.

These bowlers attack all the time.  They rarely bowl dry; they're always looking to take wickets.  And they're good enough to get wickets no matter where they play.  When everything clicks, their performances are legendary: think Marshall in Kanpur, Steyn in Nagpur, Murali at the Oval.

You'll notice that with the exception of two genius wrist spinners, every name on this list is a fast bowler.  I find this oddly gratifying.

Fast bowling is a brutally demanding profession, requiring prodigious amounts of strength, stamina, speed and skill.  It's the hardest of cricket's disciplines.  Fast bowlers regularly play through pain and strife.  It's only right that fast bowlers are also the key to team success and especially to team greatness. 

[There's a great analogy here with the role of tight forwards in rugby union.  Like fast bowlers, union forwards play the most physically demanding roles in their game.  Like fast bowlers, they need courage, endurance and pain tolerance.  Like fast bowlers, they are often perceived -- falsely -- as being less skilled than their more glamorous counterparts in the team.  And like fast bowlers, their contribution is dispositive: as the rugby proverb goes, "forwards win matches, backs decide by how much".]

In Jasprit Bumrah, India have a player who could potentially be their first all-conditions, all-world fast bowler.  Bumrah took 5fers on his first visit to South Africa, England, Australia and the West Indies.  By his 10th test, he was already the leader of India's attack.  He can extract life from the deadest of tracks, anmd regularly conjures up deliveries of outrageous skill.

Best of all from the perspective of cricket aesthetics, Bumrah is a genuinely *subcontinental* fast bowler.  Let me explain.

Most of the great fast bowlers fall into one of two patterns.  There's the tall seamer who extracts disconcerting bounce and cut from a length -- think McGrath, Garner, Ambrose, Cummins.  And there's the skiddy swing bowler who blows you away with speed and movement -- think Steyn, Starc, Waqar.  (The very best could do both, virtually on demand: all hail Malcolm Marshall). You need one of those two -- bounce or speed -- because swing alone rarely suffices; it's too dependent on conditions. 

Bumrah has both these attributes.  But he has them in a particularly subcontinental flavour.

It begins with his wildly unorthodox action: the impossibly short runup, the braced front foot, the double-windmilling arms, the release point at 11 o'clock, the follow through straight down instead of across his body.  Outside the subcontinent, he would probably have had some or all of those coached out of him, and honestly they shouldn't work so well, but work they do.  He's a true fast bowler -- not just in the sense of bowling 140kph, but also in that he hurries batters: the ball comes on to them quicker than they expect.

[At one point I wondered if his unorthodoxy was all he had going for him, but it appears not.  Mystery does not last long in modern test cricket; Bumrah's continuing excellence 4 years into his test career suggests that there's more to his success than mere surprise.]

The next subcontinental thing about Bumrah is his variety.  Perhaps it's the dustbowls he grew up on, where fast bowlers had to work hard to create opportunities; perhaps it's the influence of the IPL, where predictability is the kiss of death.  Bumrah can do it all: attacking the stumps from a length with subtle seam movement each way; conventional and reverse swing; yorkers and bouncers and slower balls.  In this, he reminds me of noone so much as Wasim Akram -- the archetype of the subcontinental fast bowler.

Yet despite his unorthodoxy and his variety, Bumrah never loses his accuracy, and that's what makes him great.  Ball after ball after ball, he gives absolutely nothing away, putting immense pressure on the batter.  Bumrah's wickets are spectacular, but it's his control on non-wicket deliveries that sets him apart. I can't wait to see what he accomplishes next.

### Hanuma Vihari and the casualties of greatness

What elevates a cricket team from best-in-the-world to all-time-great?

Intuitively, it ought to be some combination of success, longevity, and universality: does the team win most of its matches, over a sustained period of time, against all opposition, and in all conditions.  The concrete instantiation of this is winning both your home and away series against all comers, ideally over at least 2 complete cycles; at least, that's the definition that most of us instinctively reach to.

This is hard.  In fact, it's almost impossible.  In the modern era of test cricket only two teams have done this: the West Indies under Clive Lloyd, Viv Richards and Richie Richardson, and then Australia under Mark Taylor, Steve Waugh and Ricky Ponting.  

From 1976 to 1995, the West Indies won 25 of the 36 series they played in.  They drew 9 and lost just 2: a 0-1 loss in a 6-test (!!) series played on flat pitches in India in 1978-79, and a 0-1 loss in a 3-test series in NZ in 1980 (NZ's sole win was by a single wicket).  WI subsequently won in both those countries, and everywhere else to boot.  

Their secret was simple: a seemingly never-ending battery of superb pace bowlers who could take 20 wickets no matter what the conditions: Holding, Roberts, Croft, Garner, Marshall, Bishop, Ambrose and Walsh.  With bowlers like that, it hardly mattered who the batters were, but WI had those as well: Lloyd, Richards, Greenidge, Richardson and Lara.  They finally lost to Australia in 1995: a true changing of the guard.

From 1995 to 2007, Australia won 39 of the 47 series they played in.  They drew just 3, and lost just 5 series in that span.  One was a bizarre tour of Sri Lanka in 1999: Steve Waugh and Jason Gillespie broke their nose and leg respectively during the first test, and the other two tests were rained out.  Another was the famous 2005 Ashes in England.  And 3 series losses were to India away, before they conquered that "final frontier" in 2004.  

This team was built on the presence of two extraordinary bowlers: Glenn McGrath and Shane Warne.  One was a seamer and the other was a spinner, but both had the (rare) ability to simultaneously attack and restrict.  They could each bowl lots of overs, control the scoring, and also pick up boatloads of wickets, and they could do it in all sorts of playing conditions.  One such bowler will win you matches; with two, you're almost invincible.  Warne and McGrath had long and almost perfectly overlapping test careers: making their debuts in 1992 and 1993, and retiring together in 2007.  Not coincidentally, Australia's test dominance came to an end soon after, with away losses to India, South Africa and England in 2008-09.

Why do I bring this up?  Because -- whisper it -- Virat Kohli's India may be the best candidate yet to join those two teams on cricket's Olympus. 

India under Kohli and Shastri have won 17 of their last 20 series, including away series wins in Australia (twice), England, the West Indies and Sri Lanka.  They're close to invincible at home, with 25 match wins against just 2 losses.  And unlike Indian teams of the past, they're highly competitive abroad, with a win-loss ratio better than 1.  
Tours of South Africa and New Zealand beckon as their own final frontiers; if they can win one or both of those series, and if they can then sustain that level of performance for another few years (both tall orders -- nobody said it would be easy!) then I think they deserve to be spoken of in the same breath as their two great predecessors.



Other teams have tried but failed to scale this peak.  South Africa 2008-17 came closest, with 20 series wins in 28 attempts, but they never won in India, and -- bizarrely -- kept losing to Australia at home.  England actually won in India in 2012, thanks to a superbly balanced team -- Swann, Panesar, Anderson as bowlers, and Cook, Pietersen, Trott as batters -- but they couldn't keep it up.

What about the reigning WTC champions New Zealand, I hear you ask?  Much as I like Kane Williamson's team, there is little evidence to suggest they can defeat strong opposition in unfriendly conditions.  They've lost their most recent away series to each of Australia, South Africa and India (they also lost to the first two of those teams at home).  Meanwhile their series wins have been either against mediocre opposition (WI, Pak, SL), or in conditions that strongly favour their seam-and-swing attack (at home or in England).

India appear to have all the ingredients. A deep set of quality fast bowlers; the two best spinners in world cricket; a solid batting lineup; and in Jasprit Bumrah, a genuine game-breaker. 


Perhaps most telling is their bench strength.  Quantity has a quality that is all its own; you can't build longevity without it.  One of the defining features of the Aus team of the 90 was how many excellent players could not find a place in the XI -- Stuart Law, Adam Voges, Matthew Elliott, Darren Lehmann, Michael Bevan, Stuart McGill.  

India has the same problem of plenty.  Consider the openers.  India can choose between Rohit Sharma (possessor of the highest home average since Bradman); KL Rahul (test centuries outside Asia by Indian openers in to the Oval: Rahul 4, everyone else 0); Shubman Gill (debuted against Cummins, Hazlewood and Starc in Australia, and looked more comfortable than anyone else); Prithvi Shaw (child prodigy with a century on senior debut); and Mayank Agarwal (3 100s including a double in 23 innings, yet he seems 5th in the pecking order.)

Or spare a thought for Hanuma Vihari.  Topped the runs and average charts in the West Indies, did as well as the rest of the lineup on a poor tour to NZ, fought a couragesou rearguard in Sydney that was instruental ti the Indian series victoy,  And nowm can't get a look in.





India are getting there.  They've been invincible at home for some time, and that shows no signs of changing.  They beat Aus away twice, and Eng for the first time in a 4 test series since 2001,p plus away wins over WI and SL (non-trivial assignments).  Away tours of NZ and SA beckon.

Spare a thought for Hanuma Vihari.  In the last complete series he played (WI 2019), he topped the run charts and batting averages for India, ahead of Rahane, Kohli.  He did it again in NZ

Horrifying thought: is it all just luck?

And yet, the better team does win.

This suggest that in-control, chances created, expectged wickets are mussing something.
