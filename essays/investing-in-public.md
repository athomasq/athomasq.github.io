## 0. Warning: Here Be Verbiage

This is the expanded version of this essay, with copious editorial commentary.  For the TLDR version with just the stats, [click here](https://abrahamthomas.info/checks-and-balances/).

## 1. Introduction

I've been angel investing, off and on, for close to a decade, but it's only in the last year or so that I've become more intentional and systematic about it.  One aspect of this is more careful measurement of everything I do; and in the spirit of "building in public", I thought I'd share some high-level portfolio stats and commentary.  

Be warned that the commentary is copious and unfiltered.  Think of it as a combination of an internal memo on process, an investor letter to my sole LP (myself), a fly-on-the-wall documentary, and a record of some interesting times.

## 2. Why Invest in Public?

Lots of people build in public, sharing the ups and downs of the founder journey.  Far fewer invest in public.  

Why is that?  A mix of reasons.  There's reputation: failure is not a badge of honour for investors the way it can be for founders.  There's competition: the market is awash with capital, so why give away your secrets to your rivals?  And there's reticence: being able to angel invest is a privilege, and many don't want to flaunt that.

(The exception of course is the all-too-common humblebrag when a company exits: "Proud to be an investor in Acme Corp, which is IPOing today.")  

<!-- These reasons apply to me as well, but I'm in a stage of my career where frankly, I don't give a damn. -->

## 3. Caveats, Disclaimers, and Other Mealy-Mouthed Hedges

This essay is verbose, opinionated and self-indulgent, but it has its flaws as well.  

I'm an experienced investor in public markets and I know a fair bit about running startups, but I'm not a professional venture investor.  This puts me firmly in the Dunning-Kruger danger zone for this stuff.  

Some of what I hypothesize is likely to be obvious; and some of it is likely to be flat out wrong.  I'm trying hard not to be a tourist or trend-chaser, but it's hard to disentangle skill, luck, unsustainable market dynamics, and genuine macro trends.

None of the data in this essay is remotely statistically significant.  I wouldn't advise drawing any sort of conclusions from my process, portfolio, or results so far.  (Except my general awesomeness of course).

I probably contradict myself a dozen times in these notes; partly because I don't believe consistency is necessarily a virtue for investors, and partly because I don't know all the answers, so I'm thinking out loud in public.  

With all that out of the way, let's get started!

## 4. Portfolio Modeling

*"Without thoughtful [portfolio] construction, all you have is a pile of stones"* -- [Jerry Neumann](http://reactionwheel.net), liberally paraphrased


This is perhaps the area where I've evolved the most -- so much so that I'm putting it first, even before dealflow, selection and winning.  Given power law outcomes and other unique-to-startup dynamics, current market conditions, my capital constraints and risk preferences, and not least my (self-assessed) strengths and weaknesses as an investor, how should I structure my portfolio?  How many investments a year, what cheque size, which rounds to participate in, what valuations to target, when to follow on and in what size, when to exit, what win/loss ratios to target, how to recycle and so on?  There are lot of moving parts. 

So naturally, I built a model and scienced the shit out of it. 

Here's where I ended up on optimal portfolio parameters: 

<img src="/assets/img/portfolio-parameters.jpg" class="image">

This has been of immense help.  Situating each angel cheque in the context of a larger portfolio imposes investment discipline.  I think this has been the biggest single change in my investment approach in recent times.

What I found every bit as useful as the target numbers themselves was understanding their derivatives with respect to various changes in market assumptions or my behaviour.  For example:

* the more the variance around your hit rate, the more companies you need in your portfolio.
* the more power-law your outcomes, the more important it is to follow on in your winners.  
* if you double your entry valuations, you need to double your exit valuations, but only for your big winners.
* pre-committing to a set number of investments over several years allows you to invest all through the cycle.

Once written out, these conclusions seem obvious, but the exercise of modeling them out is super helpful (to me at least).

## 5. Funnel Statistics and Thoughts on Dealflow

Here's what my funnel looks like over the last 6 months:

<img src="/assets/img/funnel-stats.jpg" class="image">

I feel like I need substantially more dealflow.  My goal is to make 6-8 investments a year, and so far I seem to be on track, but it's a lumpy process.  2 investments on the same day (!) in June, none from July to September, 2 in October, 3 in November.  Should I expect a steady cadence, or is lumpiness part of the game?  Does dealflow follow a Poisson process?

I don't know, but I'd like to reach a state where I see a dozen or more terrific opportunities every year and it genuinely hurts to have to say no to half of them.  I'm not there yet.  I *think* I avoid making mediocre investments just to hit my annual deal goal, but I could be utterly wrong on that; after all, I don't see the deals that I don't see.

One interesting question is, how big does the top of my funnel need to be to support this?  Presumably an investor who sees 200 companies has better odds of finding 6 excellent ones than an investor who sees just 20.  But does one who sees 2000 do even better?  Does quantity imply quality?  At what point do diminishing returns set in?  Is there a point where the marginal value turns negative?  How much is just circularity (the best investors attract the best companies, and also more of the worst)?  

Intuitively I feel like if I invest in say 1 out of every 50 companies I see, I should end up with a pretty good portfolio, but it's not completely obvious.  (I'm currently at 1 out of every 15, more or less.)  

At any rate, one of my goals for 2022 is to double or triple my dealflow.  I have some ideas on how to do that.

<br/>

## 6. Picking Winners

Should I select companies to invest in based on team, or product, or market?  I'm a big fan of Andy Weissman's answer: **why choose?**  

Nobody's forcing me to invest, so I should be willing to pass on deal after deal until I find one that has a great team *and* a great product *and* a great market.  Anything else is a compromise.

<img src="/assets/img/team-market-product_.jpg" class="image2">

I'm getting better at this.  I can't honestly say that my first few angel investments ticked all the boxes, but my more recent ones do, or at least I think they do.  

What about traction?  Well, at the valuation ranges I invest, startups rarely have any traction worth mentioning.  Besides:

*"The dirty secret is that there is no such thing as traction pitches anymore. Because as every company knows -- the best days are always yet to come."* -- [Kevin Kwok](https://kwokchain.com/2021/09/29/narrative-distillation-1/)


<br/>

<br/>


## 7. Revealed Preferences in Company Selection

After writing the above, I went back and scored my actual portfolio on a number of factors: team, market, product, macro trends, biz model, traction and valuation.  I also scored companies that I passed on after doing deep dives, to see what factors influenced my cut. 

Empirically, it appears that I care about **team, market and macro** the most; product and biz model slightly less; and traction and valuation the least of all.  I thought I'd be pickier on business model, but it appears that I have faith that strong teams in big markets supported by powerful trends will figure it out.  Revealed preferences ftw!

*image*

Next year I might try to score *all* the companies in my funnel, not just those that made it to the final stage, but I'm not sure that's the most productive use of my time, especially if I increase my dealflow as planned.

<br/>


## 8. Investment Edge

*If you don't know the mark at the table, it's probably you.*

I spend a lot of time thinking about edge -- it's been one of the defining themes of my professioncal career.  After angel investing for some time, I now have a clearer sense of where my edge lies.  (This is the part where I blow my own trumpet).

founder -- not operator, not business exec, 
venture backed

Founder judgement
Professional investor
selling to public markets
biz model 
Deep tech

* I don't have an exceptional volume of dealflow, but I think I have somewhat *differentiated* dealflow, especially in certain under-favoured categories.

* I think my own experience as a (successful) venture-backed tech founder helps me evaluate founders differently from most non-founders, let alone investors with zero startup operating experience, especially at the very earliest stages.

* Given that I'm investing my own money, I don't care too much about logos, headlines or even horizons; I think this lets me invest in companies that many others wouldn't touch.

only 1 customer

* In my expert judgement (and I'm not being sarcastic here, or hiding behind false modesty), most VCs are terrible -- not just wrong, but glaringly incompetent -- at evaluating data businesses and also capital markets startups.  This is an opportunity to be exploited.  

So this all works, in the sense of building a performant and differentiated portfolio.  What I wonder about sometimes is, does it suffice to generate outlier outcomes?  Time will tell.

Zooming out, an angel's job is to see companies, select winners, get allocations, and help founders.  I'd rate myself average, good, good and above-average in those four competences; it gives me something to work on.

<br/>

## 9. Entry Valuations

Angel investing in 2021 is all about navigating the tension between two opposing truths:

* value investing does not work in venture;
* it's hard(er) to make money investing at high(er) valuations. 

My median entry valuation for pre-seed and seed rounds has increased every year, and I'm totally okay with that; I think it's a sign of strength.  I'd be much less sanguine investing in an asset class where valuations declined every year.

*image*

I have many more thoughts on this subject; see my notes on navigating high valuations as an angel investor. 

<br/>

<br/>

## 10. Winning Allocations

I've participated in 22 financing rounds so far (15 first cheques and 7 follow-ons).  9 of those 22 rounds (41%) have been competitive / oversubscribed.  But I've been able to get my full target allocation in every financing I've participated in.

I'm not quite sure what to make of this set of facts.  Some tentative thoughts:

- Is 43% a touch low?  It's nice to invest in companies nobody else believes in, but is that being contrarian, or simply being wrong?  Note that the value of being contrarian in inefficient markets like venture is not clear; startups are not like public stocks.

- At the same time, I wouldn't want 100% of my deals to be competitive; that would suggest the opposite, viz. that I'm not being contrarian enough, and also that I'm paying too much.

- I think something like 66% competitive, 34% contrarian would be an ideal level to shoot for.  (I have no data to support this assertion).

- There are probably a few reasons I'm able to get into every deal I bid on: the general scarcity of angel investors and early stage capital in Canada; my own credibility as a successful tech founder; my knowledge of data-AI-API businesses; co-investors and VCs who vouch for me; the small size of my cheques and so on.

- But the biggest factor is probably my dealflow, or rather lack thereof.  Chances are, I'm not being rejected because I'm not even at the table for the most competitive rounds. 

- So paradoxically, I'd like this particular stat to worsen: I'd like to have my money rejected a few times.  


So far I haven't had any problem getting allocation into any deal I've wanted to participate in.  This is a pretty strong indictment of my dealflow.  I really should be trying to get into the deals that don't want me; the Groucho Marx theory in reverse.

This probably has several causes: the general paucity of angel investors in Toronto (less competition for me), my credentials as a successful exited founder, my specialist knowledge of data-AI-API businesses, the small size of my cheques etc.  But it's also probably because I'm simply not participating in (because I don't see) the most competitive rounds.

## 10. My Actual Portfolio

My companies are the best.  

My editor (me) says I should probably write a little more about them, so here's a list.  For each company I've also included the category, a brief description, and some reasons why the investment committee (also me) picked them.

🧠 **[Daloopa](https://www.daloopa.com/)** [AI] -- AI-driven data extraction and inference for financial back offices.  Invested because I like the premise of using modern ML techniques to automate processes that are hugely costly and time-consuming for Wall St (and other) firms.

🏢 **[Mero](https://mero.co/)** [Infrastructure] -- Sensors, data and software for smarter, cleaner buildings.  Invested because of strong capital efficiency (despite the hardware component), stickiness of solution, potential wedge into high-value data and analytics, and straightforward portfolio gtm.

🌏 **[Terra.do](https://terra.do)** [Climate] -- climate community, education platform and job market.  Invested because it's a big and important idea with a huge surface area, and they have a ridiculously high NPS. 

🖥️ **[Setyl](https://www.setyl.com/)** [SaaS] -- asset, device and subscription management software for offices.  Invested because it's a simple and light-weight solution to a widespread problem, with natural growth channels. 

🏫 **[Canopy](https://www.canopyanalytics.com/)** [SaaS] -- reporting software for multi-family property managers.  Invested because it's a classic deployment-era play: bringing modern data and software functionality to a fairly staid industry.

🏡 **[BuyProperly](https://buyproperly.ca/)** [Fintech] -- Amazon meets Robinhood for home ownership: a marketplace for fractional shares of property.  Invested because they've solved lots of hard and unglamorous back-end problems to make the magic work; also terrific founder-market fit and plenty of pent-up demand.

🏗️ **[Citylitics](https://citylitics.com/)** [Infrastructure] -- data-as-a-service business covering every type of physical infrastructure.  Invested because they've put years of effort into creating a valuable and unique data asset, and are now poised to reap the rewards.

🤝 **[AcuSpire](https://www.acuspire.ai)** [AI] -- AI-driven software to generate better job *matches* (not just searches through listings or resumes).  Invested because I believe this is the next logical step in the evolution of job platforms; also, their enterprise offering is a great solution to the marketplace cold-start problem.

💡 **[Getware](https://www.getware.ai/)** [AI] -- AI-driven insights from unstructured customer interactions, surfaced and summarized at scale for product teams.  Potential customer described this to me as a "no-brainer" purchase if it works as advertised and I agree.

🚚 **[Erly](https://www.geterly.com)** [Logistics] -- Amazon-Prime-as-a-service for D2C merchants.  Invested because of a terrific value prop for merchants, a really clever business model which I can't share too much about, and incredible speed of execution.

💳 **[Klanto](https://www.klanto.com)** [Fintech] -- Spend management platform covering cards, payments, reconciliation and much more.  This is a pure execution play in a crowded space, and I'm betting on an underdog team with scrappiness, hustle and ingenuity.

💵 **[Requity](https://www.requityhomes.com)** [Fintech] -- Rent-to-own for people who can't get a mortgage despite strong cashflow.  Invested because of strong founder-market fit, neat 2-sided business model, underserved but large market, and it makes the world a better place.

🛒 **[Arima](https://www.arimadata.com)** [AI] -- 

⛵️ **[Paysail](https://paysail.us)** [Crypto] -- Using crypto rails to enable nearly instantaneous, nearly free B2B payments.  Invested because of "problem-solution fit" -- there are many ways to do payments, but this one just feels *correct* in its elegance.  My first crypto investment!

🎲 **TriplePlay** [Workplace] -- 





I try to maintain a balance between narrow / small / safe investments, and wide / big / speculative investments.  (The terms are all relative of course; nothing I invest in is "safe".)

## 10. Portfolio Decomposition

Here are a few different ways to slice my portfolio.

- By geography: 

<img src="/assets/img/slice-geography.jpg" class="image3">

I aim for 60-40 within and outside Canada, so this is mostly on track.  I tend to avoid Bay Area startups unless they're in my AI/data/API sweet spot, on the grounds that a Bay Area startup that needs money from me is not a startup I want to invest in -- the Groucho Marx theory of portfolio selection.

- By deal source: 

<img src="/assets/img/slice-channel.jpg" class="image3">

I think this is slightly above average on cold inbound.  Over time, I expect "pre-existing personal network" to diminish to a minuscule fraction, but I'm hoping that cold inbound and warm intros both grow in parallel.

- By founder demographic:

<img src="/assets/img/slice-founders.jpg" class="image3">

At a high level, 21 of 30 founders come from an underrepresented slice.  But it's mostly immigrants and minorities; not enough women.  It has not escaped my notice that I'm an immigrant minority man, so this almost certainly reflects my network and my biases.  I need to do better.

- By business model: 

<img src="/assets/img/slice-category.jpg" class="image3">

Listing them out like this, it does seem that "anything goes", as long as it's B2B or at best B2B2C.  I'm not sure this is wise; maybe I'd do better specializing?

<br/>


## 11. Post-Investment Support

*(This entire section probably massively overestimates how much influence I have and how often my portfolio founders even think of me.)*

I tell founders: "I try to help if I can, and get out of the way if I can't."  So far this seems to be working okay.  Pretty much every single founder I've invested in has reached out to me at some point to go deep into a particular problem they're facing, and the range of problems is wide. 

On average I spend 2-3 hours with each of my portfolio companies every 2-3 months.  The topics which come up most often are go-to-market, narrative creation, recruiting and team structure, and financing strategy.

What I'm still trying to figure out is whether this pull-based, problem-driven interaction is optimal, or if I can be more effective by being more proactive.  The challenge is to add that proactivity without projecting an unearned authority or a certainty that doesn't exist.  (Yes, this is pompous).  Ideally I'd like to apply the same transform to value-addition that I've done to portfolio construction: make it less ad hoc, and more intentional.

The other thing which I'm still working on is the balance between supporting founders with advice and encouragement, and pushing founders to do more, move faster, aim bigger.

## 12. Portfolio Performance

(Admit it, this is the only section most of you care about.)

I've invested in 15 startups over the last 2-ish years (my first cheque was in Oct 2019).  None of them are dead yet 😀.

As of Dec 2021, 7 out of these 15 have raised further funding (47%).  This percentage correlates with company vintage:

*image*

The portfolio as a whole is at a blended multiple of 1.8 at an IRR of 157%.  This could be a reflection of my leet stock-picking skillz, but it's far more likely to be just a symptom of a rising tide lifting all startup boats.

Here's my performance sliced by year of deployment: 

<img src="/assets/img/irr-table.png" class="image">

As the table makes clear, I've been ramping up my deal count every year.

So far the distribution of individual-company markups seems to follow a power law reasonably closely:

<img src="/assets/img/distribution-markups.jpg" class="image">

An interesting trick is to test performance with the best company omitted; my portfolio is still at 111%. 

### Previous Experiments

I had a couple of precursor portfolios before my current foray into angel investing.  From 2009 to 2014 I invested in 5 friends-and-family ventures in India.  All but one have sunk without a trace; the one is going strong and on track for a large, indeed possibly a very large outcome, but not any time soon.  

From 2015 to to 2017 I invested in 8 arms-length ventures again in India; that portfolio has done quite well (it's currently at 3.4x DPI, 5.5x TVPI and 41% IRR).  Two companies are on unicorn trajectories.  I exited one of them at a 40x markup, and am holding on to the other.  A couple of the others may return 1-3x but are unlikely to return more than that.  Standard power law dynamics, in fact. 

The performance of these two portfolios has given me a little bit of encouragement that I'm on the right track; I wouldn't be increasing my annual investment count (or dollars) without that confirmation.


<br/>

----

<br/>



## 13. Anti-Portfolio and Mistakes

There's two types of antiportfolio: companies you pass on, and companies you don't even see.

As far as I know, I have not passed on any startup that's gone on to be super successful, though of course it's early days yet.  This is in fact the strongest indictment possible of my dealflow.  My picking is good, but it can't be *that* good.  The implication of no big misses is that I'm not seeing enough high-quality companies. 

On the other side, I don't really care about false positives.  I expect 50% of my companies to lose every dollar, and a further 25% to lose most of it.  The fact that so far this has not happened is perhaps a bit concerning -- either my calibration is off, or I'm not investing in risky-enough startups, or the market is unsustainably supportive.  (Or it could just be too soon; lemons ripen early but my portfolio is earlier still.)

Yet another piece of evidence that I need to improve my dealflow is my "win rate".  So far I haven't had any problem getting allocation into any deal I've wanted to participate in.  This probably has several causes: the general paucity of angel investors in Toronto (less competition for me), my credentials as a successful exited founder, my specialist knowledge of data-AI-API businesses, the small size of my cheques etc.  But it's also probably because I'm simply not participating in (because I don't see) the most competitive rounds. 

Apart from my anti-portfolio, I think my biggest weakness is a bias towards complexity.  Sometimes the simple and obvious solutions make the best investments; a lesson I'm still learning.  


[This might be a hangover from my hedge fund days.  In public markets, if an opportunity is obvious, it will be arbitraged away; therefore you need to be contrarian to make money.  One way to do that is to embrace complexity that others avoid.  Early stage markets are not like that!]

## 14. Motivation and Goals

Going through this exercise helped me examine my own motivations for angel investing.  Why am I even doing this?  There are 3 main reasons:

* **Macro thesis**: Tech is taking over the world.  I'm a tech optimist and I believe we're still really early in tech's adoption across industries and geographies.  I want to be part of that ride. 

* **Micro thesis**: I think I have certain structural advantages as an angel investor.

* **The real reason**: I enjoy it, it's intellectually stimulating and emotionally rewarding, I think I can actually make a difference, and maybe even make some money.  

It turns out you can put those 3 reasons neatly into an Ikigai-ish framework:

I also think there's massive survivorship bias in public angel profiles.  Most angel investors and nearly all angel investments fail.  If you only look at the winners, you'll get a very skewed sense of the
