## Why this post?

I've been angel investing, off and on, for close to a decade, but it's only in the last 6 months or so that I've become more intentional and systematic about it.  One aspect of this is more careful measurement of everything I do; and in the spirit of "building in public", I thought I'd share some high-level portfolio stats.  

Note that these stats are about process, not about outcomes.  I've tried to keep editorial commentary to a minimum; but you can read an expanded version of this post with commentary here.

## Portfolio construction

My first step was being more deliberate about portfolio construction.  I've settled on a framework that fits my risk and return preferences:

- 6-8 new investments a year for 4-6 years
- 30-40 investments in total
- first cheque into pre-seed and seed rounds
- follow-on cheques into seed, A and possibly B rounds
- 1:1 reserve ratio
- 4-6 years expected time to exit

Within these companies, I aim to achieve a power-law-ish distribution of outcomes:

## Funnel stats

Here's what my funnel looked like over the last 6 months:

These 3 investments join the 7 investments I made in the preceding 2 years, giving me a portfolio of 10 companies (so far).  Unfortunately, I didn't track my funnel prior to this spring, so I don't know how this has evolved over time.

## Portfolio composition

Here are a few different ways to slice my portfolio.

By geography:

By source:

By founder demographics:

By business category:

## Portfolio performance

Here's a table showing markups and IRR by year of investment.  (Markups are based on latest closed rounds.)

DONE irr table.  So far the distribution of markups seems to follow a power law reasonably closely:

Of course, it can't be emphasize enough that these numbers are mostly meaningless, given the short timespans involved.

## Portfolio notes


#### Company selection

How did I select my investee companies?  I tried to understand my (intuitive, implicit) preferences by "scoring" my portfolio companies after I committed to invest.  Empirically, it appears that I place the most weight on team quality, market size and macro trends, all of which are non-negotiable for me; slightly less but still significant weight on business model and product/technology; and far less weight on traction and valuation.  


#### Mistakes and antiportfolio

I don't think I've passed on any startup that's gone on to be super successful, though of course it's early days yet.  This is actually an indictment of my dealflow which I think is currently my biggest weakness.


#### Post investment support

On average I spend 3-4 hours with each of my portfolio companies every 1-2 months, helping them on various tactical and strategic issues.  The topics which come up most often are go-to-market, narrative creation, recruiting and team structure, and financing strategy.  I try to stay at the meta level -- "how should we be thinking about this? -- rather than be too prescriptive -- "here's what you should do".
