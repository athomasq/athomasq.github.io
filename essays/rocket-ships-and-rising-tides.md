## Rocket Ships and Rising Tides

### Interesting Times

I’ve been angel investing, off and on, for close to a decade, but it’s only in the last 6 months or so that I’ve become more intentional and systematic about it.  

These past 6-12 months have also seen some of the most stimulating developments in tech since the late 90s.  So I thought I'd share my portfolio statistics: partly in the spirit of building in public; partly to help others calibrate, but mostly just to serve as a record of some interesting times.  

Obviously, none of this is remotely statistically significant.

### Funnel Stats

Here's what my funnel has looked like over the last 6 months:

These 3 investments join the 7 investments I made in the preceding 2 years, giving me a portfolio of 10 companies (so far). 

Unfortunately, I didn't track my funnel prior to this spring, so I don't know how this has evolved over time.

### Portfolio Goals

I've become a lot more deliberate about portfolio construction in recent months.  Here's the framework I use:

Within these companies, I aim to achieve a power-law-ish distribution of outcomes:

### Portfolio Composition

Here are a few different ways to slice my portfolio.

By business category:

By geography:

By source:

By founder demographics:

### Portfolio Performance

Here's a table showing markups and IRR by year of investment.  (Markups are based on latest closed rounds.)

So far the distribution of individual-company markups seems to follow a power law reasonably closely:

Of course, it can't be emphasized enough that these numbers are mostly meaningless, given the short timespans involved.
