title: Data in the Time of COVID-19
date: 2020-04-13
---

*Data without context is meaningless.*

*Recent weeks have seen the publication of large amounts of data on every aspect of COVID-19: from case fatality rates to unemployment statistics to environmental effects.  But without some sort of conceptual framework to make sense of this flood of information, it's just noise.*

*In Part 1 of this essay I offer one such framework, for understanding the **economic** impact of COVID-19.  In future instalments, I shall describe specific datasets and how they fit into this framework.*

### The Economic Impact of COVID-19

It is now clear that the US economy has been plunged into a sharp recession by COVID-19.  The question currently facing individuals, organizations and  policymakers is: what happens next?  

How deep will the downturn be?  How long will it last?  And how quickly will the economy recover once the worst of the virus is past us? 

<br/>

### The Garden of Forking Paths

I see three possible paths for the economy to take.

In the first and most optimistic scenario, the impact of the virus is limited to "only" health and mortality effects; there are no long-term economic consequences.  Government rescue packages succeed in bridging the short-term needs of both corporations and consumers.  Once lockdowns are relaxed, possibly as soon as late Q2, a wave of pent-up demand is unleashed.  The economy comes roaring back with above-trend growth in Q3-Q4.  There's a V-shaped recovery: think 1957 or 1991.

<br/>

In the second, somewhat pessimistic scenario, the economy takes longer to recover.  Many small businesses fail.  Unemployment spikes and stays high.  Consumption drops.  A few industries are decimated and see multiple bankrupcies (airlines, entertainment).  Monetary and fiscal policy help, but they can only cushion the blow.  The recession is prolonged, and the recovery, when it comes, is U-shaped: think 1974-75 or 2008-09.

<br/>

The third scenario is the bleakest.  Here, the desolation of small business and individual balance sheets spreads beyond those two segments.  Falling consumption triggers a negative feedback loop.  Borrowers begin to default on rent and business loans and personal debt.  Lenders suffer massive writedowns.  Credit dries up, and the economic crisis turns into a financial crisis.  (Usually it's the other way around).  Small businesses find it hard to restart.  Unemployment becomes structural.  Other wild cards come into play: supply chain disruption, infrastructure failure (water, food, power), institutional collapse.  Society is profoundly reshaped by the pandemic and its aftermath.  Think Great Depression or Panic of 1873: once-in-a-century events.

### History: Just One Damn Thing After Another 

Another way to think about these 3 scenarios is as the outcomes of a series of dominos falling.  The first domino is healthcare; the second is direct economic impact; the third is indirect and macro impact.  

The healthcare domino has already fallen.  It seems inevitable that we'll have hundreds of thousands of deaths worldwide this year, possibly millions.  And if that's the worst of it, we'll be lucky -- believe it or not, this is the optimistic scenario.

The second domino is small business and individual consumers and specific vulnerable sectors.  How badly will the disease (and society's response to it) *directly* affect production, consumption and employment for these groups?  

And the third domino is macro effects.  We know the disease directly impacts certain areas of the economy; will that impact spill over to previously unaffected sectors?  That would be true contagion (in the financial and economic sense, not the infectious disease sense). 

<br/>

### In Data We Trust, Because We Must

How do we know which of these scenarios is actually playing out?  More precisely (and tying in with my personal proclivities), what *specific data* can we look at to confirm or reject the above hypotheses for the economy?

The domino analogy is helpful here.  We should look at data that speaks to each of our three dominos: disease, micro, macro.  This is the framework that best allows us to assess the relevance *in context* of any incoming information.
