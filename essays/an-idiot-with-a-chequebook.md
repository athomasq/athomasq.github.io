## 1. Introduction: Interesting Times

I’ve been angel investing, off and on, for close to a decade, but it’s only in the last 6 months or so that I’ve become more intentional and systematic about it.  

These past 6-12 months have also seen some of the most stimulating developments in tech since the late 90s.  So I thought I'd share my portfolio statistics: partly in the spirit of building in public; partly to help others calibrate, but mostly just to serve as a record of some interesting times.  

This is the expanded version of this essay, with stats and editorial commentary.  For the TLDR version with just the stats, [click here](https://abrahamthomas.info/rocket-ships-and-rising-tides/).

## 2. Caveats, Disclaimers, and Other Mealy-Mouthed Hedges

* None of this is remotely statistically significant.  I wouldn't advise drawing any sort of conclusions from my process, portfolio, or results so far.

* I'm an experienced investor in public markets (former hedge fund manager) and I know a fair bit about startups (successful exited founder) but I'm not a professional venture investor.  This puts me firmly in the Dunning-Kruger danger zone for this stuff.  Some of what I hypothesize is likely to be obvious; and some of it is likely to be flat out wrong.

* I'm trying hard not to be a tourist or trend-chaser, but it's hard to disentangle skill, luck, unsustainable market dynamics, and genuine macro trends.

* I probably contradict myself a dozen times in these notes; partly because I don't believe consistency is necessarily a virtue for investors, and partly because I don't know all the answers so I'm thinking in public.  
* This essay is verbose, opinionated and self-indulgent, but it has its flaws as well.

## 3. High-Level Motivation

I began by examining my own motivations for angel investing.  Why am I even doing this?  There are 3-ish main reasons:

* **Macro thesis**: Tech is taking over the world.  I'm a tech optimist and I believe we're still really early in tech's adoption across industries and geographies.  I want to be part of that ride. 

* **Micro thesis**: I think I have certain structural advantages as an angel investor.

* **The real reason**: I enjoy it, it's intellectually stimulating and emotionally rewarding, I think I can actually make a difference, and maybe even make some money.  

It turns out you can put those 3 reasons neatly into an Ikigai-ish framework:

## 4. Portfolio Construction

*"Without thoughtful [portfolio] construction, all you have is a pile of stones"* -- [Jerry Neumann](http://reactionwheel.net), liberally paraphrased


This is perhaps the area where I've evolved the most.  Given power law outcomes and other unique-to-startup dynamics, current market conditions, my capital constraints and risk preferences, and not least my (self-assessed) strengths and weaknesses as an investor, how should I structure my portfolio?  How many investments a year, what cheque size, which rounds to participate in, what valuations to target, when to follow on and in what size, when to exit, what win/loss ratios to target, how to recycle and so on?  There are lot of moving parts. 

So naturally, I built a model.

This has been of immense help to me.  Situating each angel cheque in the context of a larger portfolio imposes investment discipline, and it also suggests a coherent strategy with some assurance that it'll work, if my assumptions hold.  I think this has been the biggest single change in my investment approach in recent times.

Here's where I ended up on portfolio parameters: 

<img src="/assets/img/portfolio-parameters.jpg" class="image">

What I found every bit as useful as the target numbers themselves was understanding their derivatives with respect to various changes in market assumptions or my behaviour.  For example:

* the more the variance around your hit rate, the more companies you need in your portfolio.
* the more power-law your outcomes, the more important it is to follow on in your winners.  
* if you double your entry valuations, you need to double your exit valuations, but only for your big winners.
* pre-committing to a set number of investments over several years allows you to invest all through the cycle.

Once written out, these conclusions seem obvious, but the exercise of modeling them out is super helpful (to me at least).

## 5. Funnel Statistics

Here's what my funnel looks like over the last 6 months:

<img src="/assets/img/funnel-stats.jpg" class="image">

I feel like I need substantially more dealflow.  My goal is to make 6-8 investments a year, and so far I seem to be on track, but it's a lumpy process.  I made 2 investments on the same day (!) in June, but after that it was a long dry spell till almost the end of October.  

I'd like to reach a state where I see a dozen or more terrific opportunities every year and it genuinely hurts to have to say no to half of them.  I'm not there yet.  I *think* I avoid making mediocre investments just to hit my annual deal goal, but I could be utterly wrong on that; after all, I don't see the deals that I don't see.

One interesting question is, how big does the top of my funnel need to be to support this?  Presumably an investor who sees 200 companies has better odds of finding 6 excellent ones than an investor who sees just 20.  But does one who sees 2000 do even better?  Does quantity imply quality?  At what point do diminishing returns set in?  Is there a point where the marginal value turns negative?  How much is just circularity (the best investors attract the best companies, and also more of the worst)?  

Intuitively I feel like if I invest in say 1 out of every 100 companies I see, I should end up with a pretty good portfolio, but it's not completely obvious.  (I'm currently at 1 out of every 20, more or less.)

## 6. Company Selection

Should I pick based on team, or product, or market?  I like Andy Weissman's answer: **why choose?**  

Nobody's forcing me to invest, so I should be willing to pass on deal after deal until I find one that has a great team *and* a great product *and* a great market.  Anything else is a compromise.

IMAGE venn diagram 

I'm getting better at this.  I can't honestly say that my first few angel investments ticked all the boxes, but my more recent ones do, or at least I think they do.  

What about traction?  Well, at the valuation ranges I invest, startups rarely have any traction worth mentioning.  

Besides:

*"The dirty secret is that there is no such thing as traction pitches anymore. Because as every company knows -- the best days are always yet to come."* -- [Kevin Kwok](https://kwokchain.com/2021/09/29/narrative-distillation-1/), [@kwokchain](https://twitter.com/kevinakwok)


----

After writing the above, I went back and scored my actual portfolio on a number of factors: team, market, product, macro trends, biz model, traction and valuation.  I also scored companies that I passed on after doing deep dives, to see what factors influenced my cut. 

Empirically, it appears that I care about team, market and macro the most; product and biz model slightly less; and traction and valuation the least of all.  I thought I'd be pickier on business model, but it appears that I have faith that strong teams in big markets supported by powerful trends will figure it out.  Revealed preferences ftw!

<br/>


## 7. Post-Investment Support [1]

I tell founders: "I try to help if I can, and get out of the way if I can't."  So far this seems to be working okay.  Pretty much every single founder I've invested in has reached out to me at some point to go deep into a particular problem they're facing, and the range of problems is wide. 

On average I spend 2-3 hours with each of my portfolio companies every 2-3 months.  The topics which come up most often are go-to-market, narrative creation, recruiting and team structure, and financing strategy.  [2]

What I'm still trying to figure out is whether this pull-based, problem-driven interaction is optimal, or if I can be more effective by being more proactive.  The challenge is to add that proactivity without projecting an unearned authority or a certainty that doesn't exist.  (Yes, this is pompous).  Ideally I'd like to apply the same transform to value-addition that I've done to portfolio construction: make it less ad hoc, and more intentional.

The other thing which I'm still working on is the balance between supporting founders with advice and encouragement, and pushing founders to do more, move faster, aim bigger.  [3]

## 8. Investment Edge

I wouldn't do this if I didn't think I had an edge [4].  Here's what goes into mine:

* I don't have an exceptional volume of dealflow, but I think I have somewhat *differentiated* dealflow, especially in certain under-favoured categories:

<img src="/assets/img/slice-founders.jpg" class="image3">

* I think my own experience as a (successful) venture-backed tech founder helps me evaluate founders differently from most non-founders, let alone investors with zero startup operating experience, especially at the very earliest stages.

* Given that I'm investing my own money, I don't care too much about logos, headlines or even horizons; I think this lets me invest in companies that many others wouldn't touch.

* In my expert judgement (and I'm not being sarcastic here, or hiding behind false modesty), most VCs are terrible -- not just wrong, but glaringly incompetent -- at evaluating data businesses and also capital markets startups.  Admitted, venture is an uncertain business, and anybody can be mistaken (including me), but the lack of basic knowledge of these fields is startling -- and an opportunity to be exploited.  

So this all works, in the sense of building a performant and differentiated portfolio [5].  What I wonder about sometimes is, does it suffice to generate outlier outcomes?  Time will tell.

## 9. Thoughts on Valuation [6]

Valuations, as any fule kno, have been going up across the board.  What does this imply for portfolio construction?  Should I chase the trend and pay whatever it takes to invest in good companies?  Or should I pull back and wait for the market to soften?

I believe that two things can be true at the same time: valuations are rising for reasons that are mostly legitimate, and it's hard(er) to make money investing at high(er) valuations.

Let's start with the reasons.  Here's what I believe:

* Tech is eating every industry, and we're still in the early stages of market penetration [7].   There's a lot of value remaining to be created and captured as this transition continues.

* There's an abundance of capital looking for profitable opportunites (especially given close-to-zero interest rates), and much of it will be allocated to tech as it eats up more of the world.

* As a result, terminal outcomes for tech startups are at least 2 orders of magnitude larger than almost anyone had ever anticipated.  And this propagates upstream, to the earliest stages of venture investing. 

The next thing I believe is that "value investing" does not work in venture:

* Many markets tend to be winner-takes-most, thanks to network effects, data loops, self-fulfilling prophecies, system-of-record stickiness, and narrative control. 

* Venture building has matured to the point that it's easier than ever to identify the top 1% or 10% of companies likely to succeed in any given market.

In this world, buying startups on the cheap usually means buying startups that are unlikely to deliver large outcomes.  Conversely, almost no price is too high to pay for the truly exceptional companies. 

IMAGE 2x2 of quality vs valuation

The challenge is seeing and getting a chance to invest in those exceptional companies on a consistent basis.  It's one thing if you're Benchmark, Sequoia, A16z or Tiger Global.  It's another thing entirely if you're a relatively low-profile angel investor in Toronto. 

And if you don't pick the best of the best, the math is [extremely challenging](https://avc.com/2021/11/seed-rounds-at-100mm-post-money/).

## #10. Valuation and Portfolio Positioning


So how do I square this circle?  I have two methods that work for me.  

The first is to swim upstream and invest "hilariously early", to use Hustle Fund's memorable phrase.  If the team, market and macro trends are strong, I don't care that the product is rudimentary, the business model is vague or the traction is non-existent.  I suspect most investors are not quite like that.

IMAGE pick 2 of 3

The second method is identifying startups where the founder, market, product and business are all great, but they fall into VC blind spots.  Startups helmed by women, minorities, recent immigrants, or just people outside the big-city/fancy-school tech networks often fall into this category.  

So do data businesses, saas-enabled marketplaces, and a few other hybrid models.  These are all (correctly) labelled by VCs as "tougher" to execute than your classic simple saas, ecommerce or marketplace business, but I find that the best of them have strong compensatory advantages.

IMAGE where in quadrant 1

Incidentally, these methods analogize nicely to meta-strategies that I'm familiar with from my time as a hedge fund investor.  Investing in blind-spot startups is just persistent-cognitive-bias arbitrage, and investing early is just risk-preference arbitrage.  To a quant with a hammer, everything looks like a nail.

My markups so far suggest that this approach is working, but you can't eat markups.

## 11. My Portfolio

My companies are the best.  

My editor (me) says I should probably write a little more about them, so here's a list.  For each company I've also included the category, a brief description, and why I invested (beyond the baseline reasons of team, macro and market, which are givens).

* **AcuSpire** [AI] -- AI-driven software to generate better job *matches* (not just searches through listings or resumes).  Invested because I believe this is the next logical step in the evolution of job platforms; also, their enterprise offering is a great solution to the marketplace cold-start problem.

* **BuyProperly** [Fintech] -- Amazon meets Robinhood for home ownership: a marketplace for fractional shares of property.  Invested because they've solved lots of hard and unglamorous back-end problems to make the magic work; also terrific founder-market fit and plenty of pent-up demand.

* **Canopy** [SaaS] -- reporting software for multi-family property managers.  Invested because it's a classic deployment-era play: bringing modern data and software functionality to a fairly staid industry.

* **Citylitics** [Infrastructure] -- data-as-a-service business covering every type of physical infrastructure.  Invested because they've put years of effort into creating a powerful data asset, and are now poised to reap the rewards.

* **Daloopa** [AI] -- AI-driven data extraction and inference for financial back offices.  Another classic deployment-era pattern: using modern inference techniques to automate processes that are hugely costly and time-consuming for Wall St (and other) firms.

* **Daylite** [AI] -- AI-driven insights from unstructured customer interactions, surfaced and summarized at scale for product teams.  Potential customer described this to me as a "no-brainer" purchase if it works as advertised and I agree.

* **Erly** [Logistics] -- Amazon-Prime-as-a-service for D2C merchants.  Invested because of a terrific value prop for merchants, a really clever business model which I can't share too much about, and incredible speed of execution.

* **Mero** [Infrastructure] -- Sensors, data and software for smarter, cleaner buildings.  Invested because of amazing capital efficiency (despite the hardware component), stickiness of solution, potential wedge into high-value data and analytics, and elegant portfolio gtm.

* **Setyl** [SaaS] -- asset, device and subscription management software for offices.  Invested because it's an elegant and light-weight solution to a widespread problem, with natural growth channels. 

* **Terra.do** [Climate] -- climate community, education platform and job market.  Invested because it's a big and important idea with a huge surface area, and they have the highest NPS I've ever seen.

## 12. Portfolio Decomposition

Here are a few different ways to slice my portfolio.

- By geography: 

<img src="/assets/img/slice-geography.jpg" class="image3">

I aim for 50-50 within and outside Canada, so this is mostly on track.  I tend to avoid Bay Area startups unless I have a pre-existing connection with the founder(s), on the grounds that a Bay Area startup that needs money from me is not a startup I want to invest in -- the Grouch Marx theory of portfolio selection.

- By deal source: 

<img src="/assets/img/slice-channel.jpg" class="image3">

I think this is slightly above average on cold inbound.  Over time, I expect "pre-existing personal network" to diminish to a minuscule fraction, but I'm hoping that cold inbound and warm intros both grow in parallel.

- By founder demographic:

<img src="/assets/img/slice-founders.jpg" class="image3">

At a high level, 16 of 22 founders come from an underrepresented slice.  But it's mostly immigrants and minorities; not enough women.  It has not escaped my notice that I'm an immigrant minority man, so this almost certainly reflects my network and my biases.  I need to do better.

- By business model: 

<img src="/assets/img/slice-category.jpg" class="image3">

Listing them out like this, it does seem that "anything goes", as long as it's B2B or at best B2B2C.  I'm not sure this is wise; maybe I'd do better specializing?  

I do note that lmost all of my companies have some sort of data angle (usually, a learning-loop or system-of-record effect).

<br/>


## 13. Portfolio Performance

(Admit it, this is the only section most of you care about.)

I've invested in 10 startups over the last 2 years (my first cheque was in Oct 2019).  None of them are dead yet 😀.

As of Oct 2021, 3 out of these 10 have closed further funding.  (3 more have received term sheets that will probably close in the next month or so, but I haven't included those in the stats for this section.) 1 company is on a rocket ship trajectory: hypergrowth in revenue, 8-digit series A, the works.  The whole portfolio is at a blended multiple of 2.0 at an IRR of exactly 100%.  This could be a reflection of my leet stock-picking skillz, but it's far more likely to be just a symptom of a rising tide lifting all startup boats.

Here's my performance sliced by year of deployment: 

<img src="/assets/img/irr-table.png" class="image">

As the table makes clear, I've been ramping up my deal count every year.  I tell myself this is because I'm getting better at angel investing (spending more time on it, seeing more deals), but I could be fooling myself.

So far the distribution of individual-company markups seems to follow a power law reasonably closely:

<img src="/assets/img/distribution-markups.jpg" class="image">

<br/>




## 14. Anti-Portfolio and Mistakes

There's two types of antiportfolio: companies you pass on, and companies you don't even see.

As far as I know, I have not passed on any startup that's gone on to be super successful, though of course it's early days yet.  This is in fact the strongest indictment possible of my dealflow.  My picking is good, but it can't be *that* good.  The implication of no big misses is that I'm not seeing enough high-quality companies. 

On the other side, I don't really care about false positives.  I expect 50% of my companies to lose every dollar, and a further 25% to lose most of it.  The fact that so far this has not happened is perhaps a bit concerning -- either my calibration is off, or I'm not investing in risky-enough startups, or the market is unsustainably supportive.  (Or it could just be too soon; lemons ripen early but my portfolio is earlier still.)

Yet another piece of evidence that I need to improve my dealflow is my "win rate".  So far I haven't had any problem getting allocation into any deal I've wanted to participate in.  This probably has several causes: the general paucity of angel investors in Toronto (less competition for me), my credentials as a successful exited founder, the small size of my cheques etc.  But it's also probably because I'm simply not participating in (because I don't see) the most competitive rounds. 

Apart from my anti-portfolio, I think my biggest weakness is a bias towards complexity.  Sometimes the simple and obvious solutions make the best investments; a lesson I'm still learning.

## Footnotes



[1] This entire section probably massively overestimates how much influence I have and how often my portfolio founders even think of me.

[2] Some specific questions:

- how to make your first sales hire
- how to work a conference
- how to attract talent in a hot market
- how to parse term sheets
- how to write an effective cold email
- how to structure a data science team within the org
- how to find the right gtm channels
- how to craft your narrative
- how to trade off technical debt versus feature development
- how to iterate and deploy data models fast


[3] I benefited enormously from board members who were unfailingly steady and supportive, but also challenged us to do better all the time. 

[4] If you don't know your edge, you're probably the sucker at the table.  


[5] An angel's job is to see companies, select investments, win allocations and help founders.  I'd rate myself average, good, good and above-average on those 4 competences, respectively.  I think this works. (Though see a counterpoint to the "win" rating in section 13).


[6] Yes, the world needs another hot take on tech valuations.

[7] The classic example here is US e-commerce: despite all the success of Amazon, Shopify et al, it's still [less than 20%](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/ECOMPCTSA) of retail sales.  That's only going to go up.  And there's a whole world out there beyond the USA.

[8] This too is a hangover from my hedge fund days: in public markets, if anm opportunity is obvious, it will be arbitraged away; therefore you need to be contrarian to make money; one way to do that is to seek out complexity that others avoid.  Early stage markets are not like that!
