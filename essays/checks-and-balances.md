## Angel Investing Year In Review

----

*Why even have an angel portfolio if you can't draw pretty pictures with it?*

### Introduction

I’ve been angel investing, off and on, for close to a decade, but it’s only in the last 8 months that I’ve become more intentional and systematic about it.  Part of that involves keeping better records, and so in the spirit of building in public, I thought I'd share some of my portfolio metrics.

This is the TLDR version of this essay, with just the stats.  To read an expanded version with (way too much) editorial commentary, click here.  Obviously, none of this is remotely statistically significant, but hopefully it's interesting despite that.

### Funnel Stats

Here's what my funnel has looked like over the last 8 months:

87 deals seen
39 initial calls
14 deep dives
7 yes (GEKRAPT)

These 7 investments join the 8 investments I made in the preceding 2 years, giving me a portfolio of 15 companies (so far). 

Unfortunately, I didn't track my funnel prior to this spring, so I don't know how this has evolved over time.

### Portfolio Goals

I've become a lot more deliberate about portfolio construction in recent months.  Here's the framework I use:

Within these companies, I aim to achieve a power-law-ish distribution of outcomes:

### Portfolio Composition

Here are a few different ways to slice my portfolio.

By business category:

By geography:

By source:

By founder demographics:

### Portfolio Performance

Here's a table showing markups and IRR by year of investment.

So far the distribution of individual-company markups seems to follow a power law reasonably closely:

Of course, it can't be emphasized enough that these numbers are mostly meaningless, given the short timespans involved.
