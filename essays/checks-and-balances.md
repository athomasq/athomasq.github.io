### My Angel Investing Year In Review

*Why even have an angel portfolio if you can't draw pretty pictures with it?*

### Funnel Statistics

Here's what my funnel has looked like over the last 8 months. (Unfortunately, I didn't keep detailed stats prior to this spring.)

<!-- 95 deals seen, 41 initial calls, 14 deep dives, 7 yes (GEKRAPT) -->

These 7 investments join the 8 investments I made in the preceding 2 years, giving me a portfolio of 15 companies.  

Here's a brief description of each company and [why I invested](https://abrahamthomas.info/portfolio-detailed/).

### Company Selection

I did a (post facto, completely subjective) scoring of my portfolio companies.  Empirically, it appears that I value team quality, market size and macro trends the most; and traction very little.

### Getting Allocation

Roughly half the financings I've participated in have been competitive / over-subscribed.  Despite this, I've always managed to get my full target allocation in each deal.

### Entry Valuations

My median entry valuation for pre-seed and seed rounds has increased every year.

Note that I invested in a couple of higher-valued post-seed rounds in 2021, which are excluded from the above.

By business category:

### Portfolio Performance

7 out of 15 companies have raised subsequent financing at a markup.  Here's a table showing markups and IRR by year of investment.

Of course, it can't be emphasized enough that these numbers are mostly meaningless, given the short timespans involved.

### Outcome Distributions

I aim to achieve a power-law-ish distribution of terminal outcomes, like this:

Here's the distribution of individual-company markups so far:

So far, so good.
