## Resources for Startup Founders

I was a first-time founder; so was my partner Tammer.  While we're both engineers, neither of us had ever worked in technology firms, or startups, or in the Valley: our experience was in quant finance, in New York and Asia.  We built Quandl largely to scratch our own itch; through hard work and good luck we succeeded, taking it from inception to successful exit. 

What strikes me looking back is how little we knew about building technology startups, and how much we learned along the way.  In this, we were aided immeasurably by the enormous amount of high-quality startup advice available -- for free! -- on the internet.  Back in the early 2010s, VCs were just discovering the power of content marketing to attract talented founders (VC is a dealflow business!), and they competed with each other to share their secrets with the world.  

Unfortunately, all good things come to an end.  The very success of this content marketing strategy attracted more content creators, and the average quality of startup advice online declined rapidly over the second half of the decade.  Much of what's out there today is either redundant or wrong.

When quantity increases and quality is variable, curation becomes valuable.  So I thought I'd post links to some of the resources that I found most useful in my own journey.  I've organized them by theme:

- Oracles: the voices that define this era of tech entrepreneurship
- Ideas: how to 
- Growth
- Metrics
- Sales
- Marketing
- Blogroll
- Newbies



There is a lot of material here, and for that I make no excuses.  If you're serious about building a startup, you have to put in the work.  I know of no successful founders who are not also learning machines.  And if you can benefit from other people's wisdom (instead of learning yourself by trial and error or deducing from first principles), why wouldn't you? 

Note that most of these are relevant for early stage founders, ie, from zero till about Series B -- after that, founders typically have access to far better and more focused sources of expertise than articles on the internet, no matter how insightful.

I welcome recommendations for new articles to add to this list -- please [email me] your suggestions!

## The Classics



- Pmarca Archive
- Paul Graham's collected essays
- Zero to One by Peter Thiel
- The Hard Thing About Hard Things
- YC Videos  http://startupclass.samaltman.com/
- Blitzscaling by Reid Hoffman


These 5 are essential to understanding tech as it was circa 2015.  (Why 2015?  Because there's always a lag.  The best current wisdom is to be found on Twitter and Medium and Substack; it hasn't yet been collected into a book.  See ___ section for more.

Classics from a slightly earlier era include the Lean Startup, Crossing the Chasm, the Innovator's Dilemma

## Ideas 

There's a common startup trope that ideas are unimportant, and execution is what counts.  I disagree; I think ideas matter.  They matter because to make anything worthwhile takes time.  And as a founder, I would hate to spend 5 to 10 years of my life doing something that is irrelevant, or uninteresting, or inconsequential.

How do you find a good idea?  How do you find a problem worth solving?  

- Paul Graham's [classic advice](http://www.paulgraham.com/start.html) -- "make something people want" -- is still the best counsel out there for aspiring founders.   

- How do you know when people want the thing you've made?  Marc Andreessen popularized the phrase "[product-market fit](https://pmarchive.com/guide_to_startups_part4.html)" to describe this magical stage in a startup's life. 

- Two sidebars to that are that you should make something *you* want to make (aka commitment) and that you should make something you know *how* to make (aka founder-market fit).

- One way to accomplish all these goals is to "scratch your own itch" -- solve a problem that you've previously faced.  That way you know it's a real problem, you know you want to solve it, and you have some ideas on how.  This is how [Quandl got started](/about#technology).

- Sometimes you need to experiment a bit to learn exactly what resonates.  First Round Review's [interview with Payak Kadakia](https://firstround.com/review/classpass-founder-on-how-marketplace-startups-can-achieve-product-market-fit/) of ClassPass describes this process.

- You don't need to rely on serendipity in your experiments!  [Rahul Vohra has a great post](https://firstround.com/review/how-superhuman-built-an-engine-to-find-product-market-fit/) on how Superhuman systematically d/refined their value prop for their most committed users. 

- Keith Rabois argues, and I agree with him, that you cannot pivot or iterate your way to a bold vision.  Experiments are a useful tactic but they do not replace [strategy](https://twitter.com/rabois/status/870673635375104000).  

- More ideas on ideas: look for [hobbies](https://cdixon.org/2013/03/02/what-the-smartest-people-do-on-the-weekend-is-what-everyone-else-will-do-during-the-week-in-ten-years); look for [narrative violations](http://www.bedrockcap.com/letter); look for [secrets](https://blakemasters.com/post/22866240816/peter-thiels-cs183-startup-class-11-notes).

## Growth

So you have an idea, and you've built a product, and you have some evidence of product-market fit.  How do you grow it?  

Paul Graham says startups are defined by growth, so this is a pretty important question to answer; some would say it's the key question.

There are two views.  Build a product, or build distribution.
