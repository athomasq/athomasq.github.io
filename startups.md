There's an enormous amount of high-quality startup advice available -- for free! -- on the internet.  Unfortunately, there's a much larger quantity of advice that's irrelevant, unusable or just plain wrong.

Here are a few posts that I've found helpful during the Quandl journey.  They range from absolute beginner ("what even is a startup?" -- useful for first-time founders outside Silicon Valley -- like us!) to fairly advanced and nuanced.  I'll be adding more sections over time. 

## Ideas

There's a common startup trope that ideas are unimportant, and execution is what counts.  I disagree; I think ideas matter.  They matter because to make anything worthwhile takes time.  And as a founder, I would hate to spend 5 to 10 years of my life doing something that is irrelevant, or uninteresting, or inconsequential.

How do you find a good idea?  How do you find a problem worth solving?  

- Paul Graham's [classic advice](http://www.paulgraham.com/start.html) -- "make something people want" -- is still the best counsel out there for aspiring founders.   

- How do you know when people want the thing you've made?  Marc Andreessen popularized the phrase "[product-market fit](https://pmarchive.com/guide_to_startups_part4.html)" to describe this magical stage in a startup's life. 

- Two sidebars to that are that you should make something *you* want to make (aka commitment) and that you should make something you know *how* to make (aka founder-market fit).

- One way to accomplish all these goals is to "scratch your own itch" -- solve a problem that you've previously faced.  That way you know it's a real problem, you know you want to solve it, and you have some ideas on how.  This is how [Quandl got started](/about#technology).

- Sometimes you need to experiment a bit to learn exactly what resonates.  First Round Review's [interview with Payak Kadakia](https://firstround.com/review/classpass-founder-on-how-marketplace-startups-can-achieve-product-market-fit/) of ClassPass describes this process.

- You don't need to rely on serendipity in your experiments!  [Rahul Vohra has a great post](https://firstround.com/review/how-superhuman-built-an-engine-to-find-product-market-fit/) on how Superhuman systematically d/refined their value prop for their most committed users. 

- Keith Rabois argues, and I strongly agree with him, that you cannot pivot or iterate your way to a bold vision.  Experiments are a useful tactic but they do not replace [strategy](https://twitter.com/rabois/status/870673635375104000).
