<h3 id="uftu"> <span style="color:#A9A9A9;">2024-10-08</span> &emsp; Non-Obvious Mistakes </h3>

A portfolio founder asked me the other day: "What are some non-obvious mistakes to avoid, when building a startup?" 

This is a really good question.  My belief is that building a successful startup is actually pretty simple to describe, but really hard to do well.  There are no "secrets" or "traps" or "magic" -- it's just the relentless application of common sense and good judgement.

I would say that the most common mistakes that founders make are: losing focus, slowing down, hiring too many people, not listening to the market, mismanaging their finances, and not taking care of themselves.  These are all "obvious" but people still make these mistakes all the time.  Here are my own principles on all of these: 


**1. Focus**
- Stay focused on the most important tasks  
- Say no to good ideas, so that you can work on great ideas  
- Prioritize ruthlessly  
- Avoid distractions and "shiny new toys"  
- Lean into what you do best  
- If you find something that works, just keep doing it  
- Diversification doesn't make sense for early-stage startups  
- It's very hard to do multiple things well in parallel  
- Don't optimize or automate too soon, do things that don't scale  
- Learn to tune out all the noise, hype and nonsense  
- Consistency of effort has a huge compounding effect over time  
- Pay attention to little details  
- Constantly ask yourself if you are working on the right things  

**2. Speed**
- Speed is your biggest advantage over the established competition  
- Speed of iteration gives you more opportunities to learn  
- Learning leads to better products and happier customers  
- Speed boosts morale, attracts talent, avoids burnout  
- Create and demonstrate a culture of speed across the company  
- Inculcate a bias to action, ownership, urgency across your team  
- Don't overthink or delay -- just get stuff done  
- Don't overcomplicate things; beware of analysis paralysis  
- It's better to act too soon rather than too late  
- Be careful and thoughtful about imposing structure and process

**3. Team**
- Hiring rarely solves fundamental business problems
- Adding more people usually slows you down
- Hire slowly and carefully
- Missionaries are better than mercenaries
- Attitude (enthusiasm, hard work, rate of growth) matters
- Hire people who are okay with rapid change and incomplete info
- Company culture will emerge whether you like it or not
- So it's better to plan and design it from the start
- If someone isn't working out, best to accept it and move on fast
- Look for under-appreciated talent, it's everywhere
- Protect, nurture, empower and reward your best employees

**4. Market**
- Build what the market wants, not what you think they should want
- "Get out of the room!" -- don't build in a vacuum, get market feedback
- Spend as much time as possible listening to customers
- Don't build a "solution looking for a problem"
- Don't fool yourself about your product, company, growth, or market
- Don't avoid, deny or ignore problems
- Every decision has tradeoffs, and that's okay
- Brand, reputation, trust are precious, hard to build, and easy to lose
- Don't worry too much about the competition

**5. Finances**
- Revenue solves all problems, and should be your highest priority
- Spending is a one-way street -- easy to increase, hard to cut
- Low burn is the single best way to boost your odds of success
- Low burn gives you optionality and control of your own destiny
- Be frugal but not too frugal; use common sense
- Raising venture capital is a means, not an end
- Choose partners who align with you on outcomes and risk-reward
- Be on top of your finances from day one

**6. Burnout**
- Startups often fail because the founders burn out
- Burnout can be mental, physical or emotional
- Boredom, discouragement, exhaustion, stress are all real
- Take care of yourself first -- sleep well, exercise regularly, eat healthy, rest & recharge, take vacations, spend time with loved ones
- Find joy in the journey, not the destination
- Enjoy your day-to-day work 
- Take one step at a time
- Understand your own motivations and preferences
- Work with people who energize you, not drain you 
- Positive energy is contagious; so is negative energy
- Beware of "all-or-nothing" thinking and "should" thinking
- Fall in love with the problem, not the solution

They probably sound very simplistic and cliched, but simple doesn't mean easy!  I find it's helpful to keep reminding myself of these principles.

<h3 id="cbqa"> <span style="color:#A9A9A9;">2024-10-02</span> &emsp; Quick Takes #1 </h3>

* I'm currently reading Robert Caro's biography of Lyndon Johnson, and, not gonna lie, it is every bit as good as everyone says it is.  

* I love the way the tech community uses "operator" when what they mean is "employee".  

* Quote from the best data engineer I know â€” "My output is not code, my output is data".  

<br/>

<h3 id="post-akid"> <span style="color:#A9A9A9;">2024-10-01</span> &emsp; Blogosophy </h3>

I write a newsletter with quite a few subscribers; why do I also have a blog? 

* I've realized that my preferred envelope for the newsletter is long-form essays: in-depth explorations of topics where I have expertise, or experience, or something original to stay.  

* But I also wanted a space for more frequent, often topical, sometimes self-indulgent, lower-stakes posts, where I don't have to think too much, or worry about drafting and crafting.  

* In the past, this would have been Twitter, but I don't find that platform useful anymore, either as a consumer or producer.  The thrill is long gone.  

* I'm very aware of the phenomenon whereby social networks train content creators to produce quantity over quality, to consciously maximize engagement, to always have a take, and ultimately to become addicted.  I want to avoid this; this blog is self-hosted, un-publicized, algorithmically un-optimized, and comment-free.  

* I just want to write more.  Perfect is the enemy of good; I want to lower my activation energy for putting words into the world.


<!--
*This is my page of ideas and anecdotes that I want to keep a non-ephemeral record of, but don't want to write a full essay on, or reshape for algorithmic or social-media optimization.  Some might call it a blog.*

<h3 id="lllv"> <span style="color:#A9A9A9;">2024-09-30</span> &emsp; More on Exits </h3>

A quick followup to my [previous note](/blog#zhpi) on exits.  I saw [this tweet](https://x.com/yuris/status/1839748023330714085) recently:  

<img src="/assets/img/sagalov.png" class="image_blog">

I just want to point out:

* this person is a professional venture capitalist  
* he is entrusted with investing other people's money  
* his investing model depends, utterly, on large exits  
* and yet he apparently does not track exit counts  
* so that when somebody posts them, he says, "wow, that's crazy"  

Now, I don't know Yuri personally, and a brief scan of his timeline suggests I'd probably agree with him on many topics.  But come on.  For a professional investor, this is deeply unserious. 

And he's not alone; there are *lots* of venture investors who are similarly lax.  It's the natural outcome of a 15-year rising tide where the winning strategy for VCs is marketing for deal flow, access investing, "co-opetition" networks, consensus evaluations, and targeting markups over end outcomes. Note that this strategy is evolutionarily dominant: investors who don't do this, exit the industry.


<br/>

<h3 id="lrby"> <span style="color:#A9A9A9;">2024-09-28</span> &emsp; Unicorns in Capital Markets </h3>

Empirically, it seems there are only a few pathways to mega outcomes (>5B enterprise value) in capital markets technology:

* Build an exchange - NYSE, Nasdaq, ICE, LSEG  
* Build a data business - Bloomberg, S&P, Refinitiv, Factset, Markit  
* Become a principal - every asset manager  
* Offer a very high-end service - every investment bank  

Everything else tops out at a few 100 bucks, maybe a couple of yards at best.  Makes me wonder about the risk-reward of investing in tech startups in this space ...  

<br/>

<h3 id="nzku"> <span style="color:#A9A9A9;">2024-09-24</span> &emsp; Don't Mention the Raj! </h3>

I enjoyed this thoughtful and data-filled essay on [economic stagnation in the UK](https://ukfoundations.co), and agree with pretty much all its policy prescriptions.  But one section jumped out at me.  Quoting the article:

> *There is probably nowhere else on earth that matches \[Britain's\] achievements since the mid-18th century, relative to its size and resource endowments ... It led the world in the 19th century, and then Europe during the first half of the 20th, but it lost its leadership after the Second World War.*   

Hmm, I wonder what else happened between those dates?  

Here's a hint: India produced 25% of the whole world's GDP in 1750, and only 4% in 1950.  

Here's another hint: British hegemony over India is usually considered to have begun with the Battle of Plassey in 1757; India gained independence in 1947.  

I'm sorry, but any analysis of British prosperity from 1750 to 1950 and its subsequent decline that doesn't mention the Raj, India or colonial wealth transfer even once, is not an analysis I can take seriously.  

The most charitable interpretation I can put on it is that the authors don't want to alienate their (presumably British) target audience, and hence glossed over what to me is the obvious Occam's Razor explanation.  Other interpretations exist.


<br/>

<h3 id="lzaa"> <span style="color:#A9A9A9;">2024-09-20</span> &emsp; Bad Analysis </h3>

If this is what passes for [rigorous analysis](https://x.com/daveclark85/status/1836818546115965353) among capital allocators, the venture industry is in worse shape than I thought.  God help us all.

Okay, let's use this as a learning experience: less snark, more constructivity.  Here's the full thread:

<img src="/assets/img/vencap.png" class="image_blog">

And here are my objections:

* There are at least two separate pieces of survivorship bias at play here.  First, of course, he highlights "established managers" ... "some of the best firms in the industry".  Well, of course such individual firms outperform the crowd; if they didn't, they wouldn't still be around.

* Second and subtler is survivorship bias applied to VenCap, the institutional allocator Mr Clark is the CIO of.  Of course VenCap's sample of firms outperforms the industry; again, if it didn't, VenCap wouldn't be a 37-year-history, 2-billion-AUM manager.

* 2 of the top 5 funds in his portfolio are very large.  Apparently this is the big narrative violation his thread builds up to.  Colour me unimpressed.  

* "The perception that only small funds can outperform is 100% wrong."  Straw man alert!  I don't think anybody has ever claimed any such thing.  Stating that small funds outperform large funds is not the same as stating that *only* small funds can outperform, or that no large funds can outperform.  This is such an elementary error, I'm ashamed I have to point it out. 

* "LPs need to optimise on the best managers, not focus on fund size."  Oh look, another straw man.  I don't think there's an LP in the world who makes allocation decisions purely (or even primarily) based on fund size.  

* (If anything, institutional incentives mean that LPs tend to bias towards larger funds.) 

* This is subtle but important: the combination of power-law outcomes and weighted-average TVPI calculations means that a single high-performing large fund can skew the aggregate return profile of VenCap's portoflio, in a way that's unavailable to the size-capped segments in PitchBook's sample.

* The whole thread is an exercise in small-sample extrapolation: 83 funds in VenCap's core program, versus 1053 funds in the PitchBook dataset.

* About the only thing he gets right is the core investor skillset of self-promoting how good his firm is at selection...

This is what happens when you're insulated from criticism.  At least VCs have LPs to hold them accountable; LPs have nobody. 

I wouldn't mind so much, except that he claims that he is proving his case with data. I have a professional objection to anyone who makes unfounded claims of that nature.  


<br/>

<h3 id="cxpa"> <span style="color:#A9A9A9;">2024-09-12</span> &emsp; Free Growth: Bug or Feature? </h3>

Founders will sometimes say, "the best part is, we've achieved this growth without spending a penny on sales and marketing".  *This is a mistake.*  When a founder says this, the VC hears some combination of the following:

* The founder does not know where their growth is coming from  
* The founder has no control over their growth levers  
* The founder cannot grow faster, even with investment  
* The founder is spending on growth in various implicit ways, but not accounting for it properly  
* Growth is probably linear and will plateau soon  

To be fair, VCs are also talking their book on this.  From their point of view, it's much better to meet a startup that's reliant on paid acquisition, because it means the startup is reliant on external funding, which in turn means the VC has a job.  But that doesn't mean the above critiques are invalid.

Of course, the opposite problem is worse: you're spending a lot on sales & marketing, but growth is an uphill struggle.  

The best of all worlds is when you're not spending a lot, but there's a clear line connecting what you spend and the results you achieve; and where organic and paid are complements not substitutes.

<br/>

<h3 id="spsy"> <span style="color:#A9A9A9;">2024-09-08</span> &emsp; Oh McKinsey</h3>

Haha, I just learned about a McKinsey angel investing group that has a strong preference for investing in ex McKinsey founders.  I wish I could short that portfolio.

It doesn't matter how smart, hard-working and articulate you are; being a McKinsey consultant is strongly anti-correlated with the traits that are required for startup success.  (Partly nature, partly nurture within the Firm.)

There's also some irony in having all these genius business brains outsourcing their deal evaluation to the McK undergrad hiring committee... 


<br/>

<h3 id="zhpi"> <span style="color:#A9A9A9;">2024-09-05</span> &emsp; What Will Open the Floodgates? </h3>

If you're not a hot startup in a sexy area (cough cough AI), fund-raising is tough right now.  Seed remains active, but later stages are moribund.  I'm often asked by founders, what will it take to re-open the venture market?

My one word answer is: **exits**.  VCs need to return actual cash to LPs, to prove that the last few years of paper markups weren't just a mirage.  This will help LPs rebalance portfolios which are currently (still) over-exposed to venture, and allow them to make fresh commitments to new GP vintages, which in turn should trickle down to startups.

Unfortunately, exits aren't happening.  The IPO window remains closed, and M&A is also pretty dead.  Why so?

* There's a valuation overhang from 2021: neither founders nor investors want to exit below those (insanely inflated) prices.  Some firms have taken markdowns on paper, but crystallizing them would call into doubt the entire 15-year narrative of venture as a performant, predictable, scalable asset class.  

* There's a very real fear that AI has a barbell effect on outcomes: it helps the very big (Mag 7, with all their capex resources and distribution), and it helps the very small (low-cost, long-tail solutions).  Late stage tech firms who would ordinarily IPO around now are caught in the middle.   

* This kills the growth assumptions on which SaaS multiples are based.  Why would anyone invest in firms built on 5-10 year old tech, seeing their market share getting eaten from both above and below?  SaaS feels kinda dead as a business model.  

* The FTC's recent vigorous anti-trust enforcement has blocked off large-scale (>$5B) M&A, the other material exit pathway that venture firms rely on.  

* While not a root cause, fed funds at 5% make all the above worse.  (But note that there were plenty of IPOs in the 1990s, when rates were higher.)  

Bad startups never get funded, and great startups always get funded.  What about the middle class: good-to-very-good startups?  In a healthy market, they get funded too, but we're not in a healthy market today.  We're still recovering from the excesses of 2021, and until those are cleared out, financing will remain a challenge.


<br/>

<h3 id="etui"> <span style="color:#A9A9A9;">2024-08-31</span> &emsp; On Asshole Founders </h3>

Some of the best founders are assholes.  They are unfiltered, impatient and arrogant; they play zero-sum and dominance games; push hard for the answers they want; manipulate and coerce and persuade; are ruthlessly self-centred and focused on winning at all costs.  This can be a winning template when building a business, and also when raising money from investors.

I typically don't invest founders who present this way.  My reasons:

* Strong founders being assholes doesn't mean that assholes necessarily make strong founders.  Most As are Bs does not imply that most Bs are As.  

* (also the word "most" is doing a lot of heavy lifting in the above sentence -- maybe the assholes are just more visible -- classic selection bias.)

* Even if assholes *do*, in fact, make better founders, the problem is that it's an easy signal to fake.  Acting like an asshole is a lot easier than actually building an amazing company.  Solve for the equilibrium. 

* As a solo angel, I don't need to invest in *every* strong founder; empirically, there are plenty of strong founders who are not, in fact, assholes.  (The dynamics are different for mega funds).

* Given their personal characteristics, I can't help asshole founders much.  Which is fine, but takes away one of the arbitrages available to me.

* Asshole founders typically get more investor demand and raise at higher valuations than non-assholes, thanks to their negotiating skill and investor FOMO / negging.  Investing in non-assholes is another arbitrage for me.

* As a solo angel who doesn't need the money, I have motivations beyond DPI.  Life is too short to work with assholes.

(btw all of the above applies equally well to asshole investors).

<br/>

<h3 id="alzh"> <span style="color:#A9A9A9;">2024-08-28</span> &emsp; A Mental Model for VC Rounds </h3>

Here's how to think about VC rounds:

* Series B is the scaling round.  To get a Series B, you need to prove a repeatable, scalable, growth process into a large market with solid unit economics.  

* Series A is the established-PMF round.  To get a Series A, you need to prove that you've built something that people want, that they'll pay for, and you know how to reach these people.  

* Seed is the emerging-PMF round.  You don't have indisputable evidence of PMF yet, but you have the first indications -- sometimes quantitative, sometimes qualitative -- that PMF is on the way.  

* Pre-Seed is the hypothesis round.  You don't have any evidence yet, but you have a hypothesis / reasons to believe (macro, team, tech) that the evidence will eventually emerge.  

If you're planning to follow the VC trajectory, you should know these expectations, and also play the game in lookahead mode: at each round, raise money that will help you meet the next round's criteria.

<br/>

<h3 id="ksqo"> <span style="color:#A9A9A9;">2024-08-27</span> &emsp; How Much Should I Raise?</h3>

The following things are all simultaneously true:

* It's always good to raise just a little bit more than you think you need, things always take longer than you expect  

* Don't underestimate the mental stress of limited runway / cash running out, having a margin of safety is helpful  

* But too much cash isn't helpful, it leads to bad decisions (loss of focus / urgency, chasing lower priorities, spreading too thin, loss of frugal / hustle culture)  

* You'd be surprised at how much you can accomplish with very little  

* Hiring (ie throwing more people at the problem) is almost never the answer to business challenges  

* At the same time, a really good senior hire can definitely move the needle if you find the right one  

* PMF rarely depends on building "one more feature"  

* Raising at a lower valuation makes it *significantly* easier to raise the next round  

* And this continues inductively all the way till your exit  

* Intermediate round valuations don't make a meaningful difference to your final financial outcome as a founder -- the only thing that matters is your exit valuation, times your probability of exit -- everything else is a second-order term  

* (The exception is if you are able to "skip" a round entirely eg go from seed to series B -- but that's hard/rare and risky to build a strategy around  

Net-net, my bias is always to make a frugal (not lavish) plan, where the frugality comes from staying focused and disciplined and "doing less" (ie not from skimping on costs); keep the valuation under control, but then add just a little bit of extra cash to give you a margin of safety.

(Note that I give this advise to founders *after* I invest, so I'm not talking my book or conflicted on valuation.)



<br/>

<h3 id="ixof"> <span style="color:#A9A9A9;">2024-08-24</span> &emsp; Keep Your Own Counsel </h3>

Discussing investments with other angels invariably biases towards a pass.  Because there's always flaws you can find in early stage deals -- and the more eyeballs, the more flaws.  

Given that I care a great deal more about false negatives than false positives, I want to avoid processes that tilt that way.  In an ideal world I'd want a Panglossian interlocutor who constantly asks me "yes, but what could go right?".  Most angels don't think that way!




<br/>

<h3 id="ydhr"> <span style="color:#A9A9A9;">2024-08-22</span> &emsp; Hello World! </h3>

"Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure." -- Cicero, *de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum*.  Pat yourself on the back if you know why I've used this quote.
