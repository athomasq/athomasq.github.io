## Consulting

----

<br/>

ðŸ’¡ I **advise institutional investors** on data strategy.

## Clients

* I specialize in helping firms that have historically been more fundamentals-driven in their approach, use data -- especially new sources of data and new use cases for data -- more effectively across every aspect of their investing operations.  

* I work primarily with large public markets investors -- hedge funds, asset managers, investment banks, pension plans -- but have also consulted across PE, VC, and other asset classes.  I occasionally work with sell-side research and consulting firms.

## Practice Areas

* I am an expert on all aspects of "alternative data in finance" -- datasets that have not traditionally been used by investors, that nonetheless yield tangible, actionable, repeatable investment advantages if properly applied.  I co-founded Quandl, the tech startup that pioneered this category, and led all its data operations through and beyond its acquisition by Nasdaq.

* I am extremely adept at setting up scalable, robust, operationally excellent processes for capturing value from data: from initial data evaluation, selection and acquisition; through data transformation and analysis; to analytics and insight generation; to deployment and ongoing maintenance.  

* I move seamlessly between high-level data strategy --  building highly-competent teams, defining processes and deliverables, designing technology infrastructure, fostering a data-driven culture -- and low-level data tactics -- evaluating specific datasets, use cases, technical tools, people or skills.

## Engagement Model

* I work with a very limited number of clients, and will not take on projects where I do not feel I can have a significant impact.

* Many data projects fail.  I will not hesitate to advise you to pull the plug on initiatives that, in my expert judgement, are unlikely to drive long-term performance for your firm.  

* Most of my engagements are in the form of short to medium term advisory agreements.  I'm not in the market for full-time employment at this time.  

## Contact Me

I prefer warm introductions for my consulting engagements.  You're welcome to email me, but in my experience, both you and I have greater credibility if we connect via trusted intermediaries.
