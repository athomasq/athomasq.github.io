ðŸ’¡ I **advise institutional investors** on data strategy.

* I specialize in helping firms that have historically been more fundamentals-driven in their approach, use data -- especially new sources of data and new use cases for data -- more effectively across every aspect of their investing operations.  

* As a former buy-side portfolio manager at a quant hedge fund, who then co-founded Quandl, the firm that pioneered "alternative data in finance", I have expert-level knowledge of the people, processes and technology required to build competence in modern data-driven investing.

* I work primarily with large public markets investors -- hedge funds, asset managers, pension plans -- but have also consulted across PE, VC, RE and other asset classes.
