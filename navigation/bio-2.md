I went from being a wartime refugee as a child, to a student leader in university, to a portfolio manager at a large hedge fund, to co-founder of a successful tech startup.  This is my story.

Here's the concise "professional profile" version:

Abraham Thomas is a private investor, board member, and advisor to technology companies and investment firms.  He's an expert on data assets and data businesses, and he writes the well-regarded Pivotal newsletter on those topics.  

Abraham was previously the co-founder and chief data officer of Quandl, the leading "alternative data" provider in the world, now a Nasdaq company.  Before Quandl, Abraham was a senior portfolio manager at Simplex Asset Management, one of Asia's oldest and largest quant hedge funds, where he built one of the industry's first high-frequency-trading systems.  

Abraham has a B. Tech. from IIT Bombay.  He lives in Toronto, Canada.

Here's the longer and more interesting version:

**Childhood.** I was born in a small town in south India.  The formative experience of my childhood was this: at the age of 13, I spent 3 days in the hold of a cargo ship, escaping a war zone with nothing more than what I could carry in a backpack.  This gave me (what I think is) unusual levels of optimism, detachment, perspective, and risk tolerance.

**School.** I graduated from high school as valedictorian and head boy.  I was on my school’s debate, quiz, math, soccer, track and basketball teams (captaining the first four), and won intramural and interscholastic (state, regional) competitions with all of them; I also edited the school magazine.  I did these for fun: extracurriculars don't count towards college admissions in India.

I was subsequently accepted, via competitive exam, into India's top medical school AIIMS, as well as India's top engineering school IIT Bombay (<0.2% admit rates at each; non-overlapping exams!).  I chose to join the latter.

**IIT.** I graduated from IIT Bombay with a B.Tech. in Engineering Physics.  While at IIT-B, I was elected Institute General Secretary (GSHA -- the highest post in student government) with a record number of votes, and served as the student rep on IIT-B's Senate. I captained IIT-B's quiz, debate and literary teams, and won many intercollegiate and national competitions. I was also very active in competitive intramurals, and won a bunch of awards including the institute's "Roll of Honour".

I realized that a career in physics academia was not for me.  After graduating, I was accepted into India's top business school IIM-A (I believe I ranked #1 in the entrance exam; <0.2% acceptance rate again), but decided not to go.  Instead, I joined a Japanese hedge fund, Simplex Asset Management.

**Simplex.** Simplex, headquartered in Tokyo, is one of Asia's oldest and largest quant hedge funds, with several billion under management.  I joined them as employee #7, and helped build most of their core trading systems.  I started as a programmer and quant analyst, then became a junior trader, and eventually, senior portfolio manager and head of all non-Japan investments.  While at Simplex, I built one of the earliest high-frequency-trading systems in the industry, for automated quant trading of the US Treasury market. 

My best trade at Simplex was my last one: I exited all my positions at the high-water mark in 2007, just before the global financial crisis of 2008.  I then quit my hedge fund job and moved to Toronto, looking for new challenges.

**Quandl.** A few years later, I started Quandl with my friend and co-founder Tammer Kamel.  We set out to solve a well-known problem: there’s an enormous amount of valuable data in the world, but it’s fragmented and intractable: hard to find and hard to use.  We built technology to aggregate and harmonize millions of datasets from thousands of sources, all in a single data marketplace with a uniform, powerful API.

Quandl pioneered the category of "alternative data for finance" -- datasets of great value to professional investors, but previously unused (and often unknown).  Our alt data was used by a majority of the world's top hedge funds, asset managers, fintechs, and investment banks, serving millions of downloads and powering billions in investment decisions. 

I wore many hats at Quandl: heading all things data; raising $20M in venture capital from blue-chip Silicon Valley investors; managing (at various times) finance, marketing, sales and ops; recruiting and team-building; and perhaps most importantly, setting culture and vision.

Quandl was acquired by Nasdaq in 2018, in a substantial and successful exit.  Tammer and I stayed on to run the business for a while longer, before moving on.

**Free Agent.** I've been a free agent for the last few years.  I'm an active and successful angel investor in early-stage tech startups (40+ portfolio copmanies, 25% blended IRR, meaningful DPI).  I also write Pivotal, a highly-regarded newsletter on data, investing and startups with over 5000 subscribers.  I advise a small and select group of firm (both tech startups and investment managers), and I serve on private-company boards.

**And More.**  I'm insatiably curious, and a lifelong learner-doer.  In parallel with my professional adventures, I keep busy with lots of hobbies, pursuits, side-projects and weekend exploits.  I used to run a poem-a-day mail server in the late 90s with over 5000 subscribers.  I played tournament Scrabble and reached expert level (1600).  I used to hike and bike, but do less of that now.  I'm a solid tennis player (4.0), and getting into distance swimming and weight-training (kettlebells).  I volunteer.

I'm a very good amateur photographer.  I have a large collection of tabletop (Euro-strategy) board games.  I listen to a vast range of music (but not the popular stuff I'm afraid).  I play multiple instruments, badly.  I read non-stop, on everything under the sun.  I've travelled a bit, and even written a travel guide.  I think I'm unusually well-informed on a very wide range of topics: history, science, art, language, music, literature, you name it.  I'm interested in everything.

I currently live in Toronto with my family, 7000 books, and 3 pianos.
