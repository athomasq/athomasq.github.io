## Thinking in Public

*Inspired by [@thesephist](https://x.com/thesephist), this is my page of ideas and anecdotes that I want to keep a non-ephemeral record of, but don't want to write a full essay on, or reshape for algorithmic or social-media optimization.*

<h3> <span style="color:#A9A9A9;">2024-08-30</span> &emsp; Is Free Growth a Bug or a Feature? </h3>

Founders will sometimes say, "the best part is, we've achieved this growth without spending a penny on sales and marketing".  *This is a mistake.*  When a founder says this, the VC hears some combination of the following:

* The founder does not know where their growth is coming from

* The founder has no control over their growth levers

* The founder cannot scale up or accelerate growth, even with investment

* The founder is in fact spending on growth, but they're not accounting for it properly

* Growth is probably linear and will plateau soon

(To be fair, VCs are also talking their book on this: from their point of view, it's much better to meet a startup that's reliant on paid acquisition, because it means the startup is reliant on external funding, which in turn means the VC has a job.  But that doesn't mean the above critiques are invalid.)

Of course, the opposite problem is worse: you're spending a lot on sales & marketing, but growth is an uphill struggle.  

The best of all worlds is when you're not spending a lot, but there's a clear line connecting what you spend and the results you achieve; and where organic and paid are complements not substitutes.

<h3> <span style="color:#A9A9A9;">2024-08-28</span> &emsp; On Asshole Founders </h3>


Some of the best founders are assholes.  They are unfiltered, impatient and arrogant; they play zero-sum and dominance games; push hard for the answers they want; manipulate and coerce and persuade; are ruthlessly self-centred and focused on winning at all costs.  This can be a winning template when building a business, and also when raising money from investors.

I typically don't invest founders who present this way.  My reasons:

* Strong founders being assholes doesn't mean that assholes necessarily make strong founders.  Most As are Bs does not imply that most Bs are As.  

* (also the word "most" is doing a lot of heavy lifting in the above sentence -- maybe the assholes are just more visible -- classic selection bias.)

* Even if assholes *do*, in fact, make better founders, the problem is that it's an easy signal to fake.  Acting like an asshole is a lot easier than actually building an amazing company.  Solve for the equilibrium. 

* As a solo angel, I don't need to invest in *every* strong founder; empirically, there are plenty of strong founders who are not, in fact, assholes.  (The dynamics are different for mega funds).

* Given their personal characteristics, I can't help asshole founders much.  Which is fine, but takes away one of the arbitrages available to me.

* Asshole founders typically get more investor demand and raise at higher valuations than non-assholes, thanks to their negotiating skill and investor FOMO / negging.  Investing in non-assholes is another arbitrage for me.

* As a solo angel who doesn't need the money, I have motivations beyond DPI.  Life is too short to work with assholes.

(btw all of the above applies equally well to asshole investors).

<h3> <span style="color:#A9A9A9;">2024-08-28</span> &emsp; A Mental Model for VC Rounds </h3>

Here's how to think about VC rounds:

* Series B is the scaling round.  To get a Series B, you need to prove a repeatable, scalable, growth process into a large market with solid unit economics.  

* Series A is the established-PMF round.  To get a Series A, you need to prove that you've built something that people want, that they'll pay for, and you know how to reach these people.  

* Seed is the emerging-PMF round.  You don't have indisputable evidence of PMF yet, but you have the first indications -- sometimes quantitative, sometimes qualitative -- that PMF is on the way.  

* Pre-Seed is the hypothesis round.  You don't have any evidence yet, but you have a hypothesis / reasons to believe (macro, team, tech) that the evidence will eventually emerge.

<h3> <span style="color:#A9A9A9;">2024-08-27</span> &emsp; Raise Less at a Lower Valuation </h3>

The following things are all simultaneously true:

* It's always good to raise just a little bit more than you think you need, things always take longer than you expect  

* Don't underestimate the mental stress of limited runway / cash running out, having a margin of safety is helpful  

* But too much cash isn't helpful, it leads to bad decisions (loss of focus / urgency, chasing lower priorities, spreading too thin, loss of frugal / hustle culture)  

* You'd be surprised at how much you can accomplish with very little  

* Hiring (ie throwing more people at the problem) is almost never the answer to business challenges  

* At the same time, a really good senior hire can definitely move the needle if you find the right one  

* PMF rarely depends on building "one more feature"  

* Raising at a lower valuation makes it *significantly* easier to raise the next round  

* And this continues inductively all the way till your exit  

* Intermediate round valuations don't make a meaningful difference to your final financial outcome as a founder -- the only thing that matters is your exit valuation, times your probability of exit -- everything else is a second-order term  

* (The exception is if you are able to "skip" a round entirely eg go from seed to series B -- but that's hard/rare and risky to build a strategy around  

Net-net, my bias is always to make a frugal (not lavish) plan, where the frugality comes from staying focused and disciplined and "doing less" (ie not from skimping on costs); keep the valuation under control, but then add just a little bit of extra cash to give you a margin of safety.

(Note that I give this advise to founders *after* I invest, so I'm not talking my book or conflicted on valuation.)

<h3> <span style="color:#A9A9A9;">2024-07-19</span> &emsp; Angelling is a Solo Sport </h3>

Discussing investments with other angels invariably biases towards a pass.  Because there's always flaws you can find in early stage deals -- and the more eyeballs, the more flaws.  Given that I care a great deal more about false negatives than false positives, I want to avoid processes that tilt that way -- in an ideal world I'd want a Panglossian interlocutor who constantly asks me "yes, but what could go right?".  Most angels don't think that way!

"Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure." -- Cicero, *de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum*.  Pat yourself on the back if you know why I've used this quote.
