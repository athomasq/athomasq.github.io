<h3> <span style="color:#A9A9A9;">2024-09-24</span> &emsp; Don't Mention the Raj! </h3>

I enjoyed this thoughtful and data-filled essay on [economic stagnation in the UK](https://ukfoundations.co), and agree with pretty much all its policy prescriptions.  But one section jumped out at me.  Quoting the article:

> *There is probably nowhere else on earth that matches \[Britain's\] achievements since the mid-18th century, relative to its size and resource endowments ... It led the world in the 19th century, and then Europe during the first half of the 20th, but it lost its leadership after the Second World War.*   

Hmm, I wonder what else happened between those dates?  

Here's a hint: India produced 25% of the whole world's GDP in 1750, and only 4% in 1950.  

Here's another hint: British hegemony over India is usually considered to have begun with the Battle of Plassey in 1757; India gained independence in 1947.  

I'm sorry, but any analysis of British prosperity from 1750 to 1950 and its subsequent decline that doesn't mention the Raj, India or colonial wealth transfer even once, is not an analysis I can take seriously.  

The most charitable interpretation I can put on it is that the authors don't want to alienate their (presumably British) target audience, and hence glossed over what to me is the obvious Occam's Razor explanation.  Other interpretations exist.

<h3> <span style="color:#A9A9A9;">2024-09-24</span> &emsp; Bad Analysis </h3>

If this is what passes for [rigorous analysis](https://x.com/daveclark85/status/1836818546115965353) among capital allocators, the venture industry is in worse shape than I thought.  God help us all.

Okay, let's use this as a learning experience: less snark, more constructivity.  Here's the full thread:

<img src="/assets/img/vencap.png" class="image">

And here are my objections:

* There are at least two separate pieces of survivorship bias at play here.  First, of course, he highlights "established managers" ... "some of the best firms in the industry".  Well, of course such individual firms outperform the crowd; if they didn't, they wouldn't still be around.

* Second and subtler is survivorship bias applied to VenCap, the institutional allocator Mr Clark is the CIO of.  Of course VenCap's sample of firms outperforms the industry; again, if it didn't, VenCap wouldn't be a 37-year-history, 2-billion-AUM manager.

* 2 of the top 5 funds in his portfolio are very large.  Apparently this is the big narrative violation his thread builds up to.  Colour me unimpressed.  

* "The perception that only small funds can outperform is 100% wrong."  Straw man alert!  I don't think anybody has ever claimed any such thing.  

* "LPs need to optimise on the best managers, not focus on fund size."  Oh look, another straw man.  I don't think there's an LP in the world who makes allocation decisions purely (or even primarily) based on fund size.  

* (If anything, institutional incentives mean that LPs tend to bias towards larger funds.) 

* (Also, this is the first time I've seen the [midwit meme](https://x.com/daveclark85/status/1837070736365670577) with the same statement at all levels of IQ.)

* This is subtle but important: the combination of power-law outcomes and weighted-average TVPI calculations means that a single high-performing large fund can skew the aggregate return profile of VenCap's portoflio, in a way that's unavailable to the size-capped segments in PitchBook's sample.

* The whole thread is an exercise in small-sample extrapolation: 83 funds in VenCap's core program, versus 1053 funds in the PitchBook dataset.

* About the only thing he gets right is the core investor skillset of self-promoting how good his firm is at selection...

This is what happens when you're insulated from criticism.  At least VCs have LPs to hold them accountable; LPs have nobody. 

I wouldn't mind so much, except that he claims that he is proving his case with data. I have a professional objection to anyone who makes unfounded claims of that nature.

<h3 id="post-0005"> <span style="color:#A9A9A9;">2024-09-12</span> &emsp;Oh McKinsey!</h3>

Haha, I just learned about a McKinsey angel investing group that has a strong preference for investing in ex McKinsey founders.  I wish I could short that portfolio.

It doesn't matter how smart, hard-working and articulate you are; being a McKinsey consultant is strongly anti-correlated with the traits that are required for startup success.  (Partly nature, partly nurture within the Firm.)

There's also some irony in having all these genius business brains outsourcing their deal evaluation to the McK undergrad hiring committee...

<h3 id="post-0005"> <span style="color:#A9A9A9;">2024-08-30</span> &emsp; Is Free Growth a Bug or a Feature? </h3>

Founders will sometimes say, "the best part is, we've achieved this growth without spending a penny on sales and marketing".  *This is a mistake.*  When a founder says this, the VC hears some combination of the following:

* The founder does not know where their growth is coming from  
* The founder has no control over their growth levers  
* The founder cannot grow faster, even with investment  
* The founder is spending on growth in various implicit ways, but not accounting for it properly  
* Growth is probably linear and will plateau soon  

To be fair, VCs are also talking their book on this.  From their point of view, it's much better to meet a startup that's reliant on paid acquisition, because it means the startup is reliant on external funding, which in turn means the VC has a job.  But that doesn't mean the above critiques are invalid.

Of course, the opposite problem is worse: you're spending a lot on sales & marketing, but growth is an uphill struggle.  

The best of all worlds is when you're not spending a lot, but there's a clear line connecting what you spend and the results you achieve; and where organic and paid are complements not substitutes.

<h3 id="post-0004"> <span style="color:#A9A9A9;">2024-08-28</span> &emsp; On Asshole Founders </h3>

Some of the best founders are assholes.  They are unfiltered, impatient and arrogant; they play zero-sum and dominance games; push hard for the answers they want; manipulate and coerce and persuade; are ruthlessly self-centred and focused on winning at all costs.  This can be a winning template when building a business, and also when raising money from investors.

I typically don't invest founders who present this way.  My reasons:

* Strong founders being assholes doesn't mean that assholes necessarily make strong founders.  Most As are Bs does not imply that most Bs are As.  

* (also the word "most" is doing a lot of heavy lifting in the above sentence -- maybe the assholes are just more visible -- classic selection bias.)

* Even if assholes *do*, in fact, make better founders, the problem is that it's an easy signal to fake.  Acting like an asshole is a lot easier than actually building an amazing company.  Solve for the equilibrium. 

* As a solo angel, I don't need to invest in *every* strong founder; empirically, there are plenty of strong founders who are not, in fact, assholes.  (The dynamics are different for mega funds).

* Given their personal characteristics, I can't help asshole founders much.  Which is fine, but takes away one of the arbitrages available to me.

* Asshole founders typically get more investor demand and raise at higher valuations than non-assholes, thanks to their negotiating skill and investor FOMO / negging.  Investing in non-assholes is another arbitrage for me.

* As a solo angel who doesn't need the money, I have motivations beyond DPI.  Life is too short to work with assholes.

(btw all of the above applies equally well to asshole investors).

<h3 id="post-0004"> <span style="color:#A9A9A9;">2024-08-28</span> &emsp; A Mental Model for VC Rounds </h3>

Here's how to think about VC rounds:

* Series B is the scaling round.  To get a Series B, you need to prove a repeatable, scalable, growth process into a large market with solid unit economics.  

* Series A is the established-PMF round.  To get a Series A, you need to prove that you've built something that people want, that they'll pay for, and you know how to reach these people.  

* Seed is the emerging-PMF round.  You don't have indisputable evidence of PMF yet, but you have the first indications -- sometimes quantitative, sometimes qualitative -- that PMF is on the way.  

* Pre-Seed is the hypothesis round.  You don't have any evidence yet, but you have a hypothesis / reasons to believe (macro, team, tech) that the evidence will eventually emerge.  

If you're planning to follow the VC trajectory, you should know these expectations, and also play the game in lookahead mode: at each round, raise money that will help you meet the next round's criteria.

<br/>

<h3 id="post-0003"> <span style="color:#A9A9A9;">2024-08-27</span> &emsp; Raise Less, Focus More</h3>

The following things are all simultaneously true:

* It's always good to raise just a little bit more than you think you need, things always take longer than you expect  

* Don't underestimate the mental stress of limited runway / cash running out, having a margin of safety is helpful  

* But too much cash isn't helpful, it leads to bad decisions (loss of focus / urgency, chasing lower priorities, spreading too thin, loss of frugal / hustle culture)  

* You'd be surprised at how much you can accomplish with very little  

* Hiring (ie throwing more people at the problem) is almost never the answer to business challenges  

* At the same time, a really good senior hire can definitely move the needle if you find the right one  

* PMF rarely depends on building "one more feature"  

* Raising at a lower valuation makes it *significantly* easier to raise the next round  

* And this continues inductively all the way till your exit  

* Intermediate round valuations don't make a meaningful difference to your final financial outcome as a founder -- the only thing that matters is your exit valuation, times your probability of exit -- everything else is a second-order term  

* (The exception is if you are able to "skip" a round entirely eg go from seed to series B -- but that's hard/rare and risky to build a strategy around  

Net-net, my bias is always to make a frugal (not lavish) plan, where the frugality comes from staying focused and disciplined and "doing less" (ie not from skimping on costs); keep the valuation under control, but then add just a little bit of extra cash to give you a margin of safety.

(Note that I give this advise to founders *after* I invest, so I'm not talking my book or conflicted on valuation.)

<h3 id="post-0002"> <span style="color:#A9A9A9;">2024-07-19</span> &emsp; Keep Your Own Counsel </h3>

Discussing investments with other angels invariably biases towards a pass.  Because there's always flaws you can find in early stage deals -- and the more eyeballs, the more flaws.  Given that I care a great deal more about false negatives than false positives, I want to avoid processes that tilt that way -- in an ideal world I'd want a Panglossian interlocutor who constantly asks me "yes, but what could go right?".  Most angels don't think that way!

<h3 id="post-0001"> <span style="color:#A9A9A9;">2024-06-23</span> &emsp; Hello World! </h3>

"Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure." -- Cicero, *de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum*.  Pat yourself on the back if you know why I've used this quote.
