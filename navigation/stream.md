## Thinking in Public

----

*Inspired by [@thesephist](https://x.com/thesephist), this is my page of ideas and anecdotes that I want to keep a non-ephemeral record of, but don't want to write a full essay on, or reshape for algorithmic or social-media optimization.*

<h3> <span style="color:#A9A9A9;">2024-08-28</span> &emsp; A Mental Model for VC Rounds </h3>

Here's how to think about VC rounds:

* Series B is the scaling round.  To get a Series B, you need to prove a repeatable, scalable, growth process into a large market with solid unit economics.  

* Series A is the established-PMF round.  To get a Series A, you need to prove that you've built something that people want, that they'll pay for, and you know how to reach these people.  

* Seed is the emerging-PMF round.  You don't have indisputable evidence of PMF yet, but you have the first indications -- sometimes quantitative, sometimes qualitative -- that PMF is on the way.  

* Pre-Seed is the hypothesis round.  You don't have any evidence yet, but you have a hypothesis / reasons to believe (macro, team, tech) that the evidence will eventually emerge.

<h3> <span style="color:#A9A9A9;">2024-08-27</span> &emsp; Raise Less at a Lower Valuation </h3>


The following things are all simultaneously true:

* It's always good to raise just a little bit more than you think you need, things always take longer than you expect  
* Don't underestimate the mental stress of limited runway / cash running out, having a margin of safety is helpful  
* bBt too much cash isn't helpful, it leads to bad decisions (loss of focus / urgency, chasing lower priorities, spreading too thin, loss of frugal / hustle culture)  
* you'd be surprised at how much you can accomplish with very little  
* hiring (ie throwing more people at the problem) is almost never the answer to business challenges  
* at the same time, a really good senior hire can definitely move the needle if you find the right one  
* PMF rarely depends on building "one more feature"  
* Raising at a lower valuation makes it *significantly* easier to raise the next round  
* And this continues inductively all the way till your exit  
* Intermediate round valuations don't make a meaningful difference to your final financial outcome as a founder -- the only thing that matters is your exit valuation, times your probability of exit -- everything else is a second-order term  
* (The exception is if you are able to "skip" a round entirely eg go from seed to series B -- but that's hard/rare and risky to build a strategy around  

Net-net, my bias is always to make a frugal (not lavish) plan, where the frugality comes from staying focused and disciplined and "doing less" (ie not from skimping on costs); keep the valuation under control, but then add just a little bit of extra cash to give you a margin of safety.

(Note that I give this advise to founders *after* I invest, so I'm not talking my book or conflicted on valuation.)

Discussing investments with other angels invariably biases towards a pass.  Because there's always flaws you can find in early stage deals -- and the more eyeballs, the more flaws.  Given that I care a great deal more about false negatives than false positives, I want to avoid processes that tilt that way -- in an ideal world I'd want a Panglossian interlocutor who constantly asks me "yes, but what could go right?".  Most angels don't think that way!

"Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure." -- Cicero, *de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum*.  Pat yourself on the back if you know why I've used this quote.
