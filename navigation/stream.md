## Thinking in Public

*Inspired by [@thesephist](https://x.com/thesephist), this is my page of ideas and anecdotes that I want to keep a non-ephemeral record of, but don't want to write a full essay on, or reshape for algorithmic or social-media optimization.*

Discussing investments with other angels invariably biases towards a pass.  Because there's always flaws you can find in early stage deals -- and the more eyeballs, the more flaws.  Given that I care a great deal more about false negatives than false positives, I want to avoid processes that tilt that way -- in an ideal world I'd want a Panglossian interlocutor who constantly asks me "yes, but what could go right?".  Most angels don't think that way!

"Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure." -- Cicero, *de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum*.  Pat yourself on the back if you know why I've used this quote.
