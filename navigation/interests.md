## What I'm Interested In



----

<br/> 

### 💻 Professional 

My professional interests lie at the intersection of data, markets, and technology.

📀 **Data:** As a species, we are defined by our ability to manipulate information: language, writing, software. It's not a coincidence that the word we associate most strongly with human evolutionary advantage — intelligence — means both raw data, and the capacity to act on it.

🏪 **Markets:** Markets are the most effective and resilient mechanism we have found to solve a hard problem: how should society allocate resources in the face of incomplete information and uncertain outcomes?

📡 **Technology:** Writing, agriculture, government, cities, money, industry: these and other technologies have impacted humanity in profound (and still evolving) ways. We're living through another technological revolution right now: software. And we've barely scratched the surface of what it can achieve.

If you're also interested in these themes, I strongly recommend subscribing to my newsletter, [Pivotal](https://pivotal.substack.com/about).

### ⚖️ Ethical

While I believe in the ability of markets, data and technology to make the world a better place, I'm also keenly aware of their limitations. 

😑 Data can be noisy, messy or incomplete; more dangerously, it can be misleading, biased or falsified.  Not all questions can be answered with data.  High-quality decision-making under uncertainty with imperfect information is hard, and therefore valuable.

🏴‍☠️ Markets can be imperfect, incomplete, non-competitive, regulated, corrupt, captured, rigged or otherwise flawed.  Flawed markets lead to information errors, poor incentives and inequitable outcomes.  

💣 Technology is vulnerable to incompetence, malice, misuse, indifference, bias and unforeseen consequences.

The optimist (and ex trader) in me says that every inefficiency is an opportunity; the humanist in me cares for the individuals affected by these inefficiencies.  Using data-markets-technology to make the world a truly better place is not easy.  But what better way to spend one's life?

### 🧭 Exploring

I'm currently exploring ideas in the AI/ML space, especially around data, data tools, and data business models. Some things I'm looking at:

💎 Proprietary, latent, golden and small data assets; and how to build, connect and capture value from those assets.

🛠 Data infrastructure, especially tools that help generative models become first-class consumers as well as producers of data.

🤝 Trust hierarchies and the confidence chain: signatures, provenance, identity, curation, quality.

🤖 The compute explosion, software-in-the-loop, ubiquitous agents, matching versus ranking, productivity versus distribution.

🔑 New areas of abundance and scarcity, especially energy, hardware, and "atoms not bits".

If you're working on any of these, I'd love to [hear from you](mailto:at@abrahamthomas.info).

### ❤️ Personal

I have a number of hobbies and interests that keep me pleasantly busy:

📚 I'm endlessly curious and an unapologetic [bibliophile](/library)

✈️ I like to travel, both physically and [in spirit](/library/#travel-adventure--exploration)    
🎲 I like to play Euro-style board games  
🎨 I haunt galleries and museums whenever I can  
🍱 I like to cook, and also to eat well  
🎶 I like to discover new music of almost every genre  
🏅 I over-analyze sports, using data of course  
🎾 I play semi-competitive tennis (NTRP 4.5) (trending lower)  
🔠 I used to play tournament Scrabble, but haven't for a while   
🌸 I used to curate a rather popular poetry newsletter  
🏋🏾 I work out, sleep well, and practise happiness  
📋 I'm a prolific list-maker, curator and reviewer  
✒️ I like to [write](/writing), as this website makes abundantly clear 🙂

### 📡 Philosophy

The Greek philosopher Anaximenes asked: “Why should I study the stars, when there is suffering and misery here on Earth?”. 

Today, we know the answer.  *The best way to alleviate suffering and misery is through progress.*  Scientific progress to expand the productive frontier; economic progress to balance equity and efficiency; and societal progress to enable not just surviving but thriving.  Studying the stars and investing in the future: that's, ultimately, what I'm interested in.
