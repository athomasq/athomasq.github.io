## My Work

----

<br/> 

### 💻 Interests 

My professional interests lie at the intersection of data, markets, and technology.

📀 **Data:** As a species, we are defined by our ability to manipulate information: language, writing, software. It's not a coincidence that the word we associate most strongly with human evolutionary advantage — intelligence — means both raw data, and the capacity to act on it.

🏪 **Markets:** Markets are the most effective and resilient mechanism we have found to solve a hard problem: how should society allocate resources in the face of incomplete information and uncertain outcomes?

📡 **Technology:** Writing, agriculture, government, cities, money, industry: these and other technologies have impacted humanity in profound ways. We're living through another technological revolution right now: software. And we've barely scratched the surface of what it can achieve.

### 📃 Career


🖋️ I write [Pivotal](https://pivotal.substack.com/about), a highly-regarded newsletter on data, investing, and startups, with over 5000 subscribers.  Click on the link to learn more, hear what people have to say about it, and subscribe.

🌱 I'm an active, engaged, and successful angel investor in early-stage technology startups. I've invested directly in over 40 companies over the last 12+ years; I'm also an LP in multiple VC funds.  My [investing](/investing) page has more details, including performance statistics.

🔮 I serve on a private company boards, advise a small and select group of startups, and consult for an even smaller group of larger organizations.

🚀 Previously, I co-founded Quandl, a SaaS-enabled B2B marketplace for data. We pioneered the category of [alternative data for finance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_data_(finance)), changing the industry along the way. Quandl was acquired by Nasdaq in 2018 in a successful and substantial exit.  

📈 I was an early employee at Simplex Asset Management, one of Asia's oldest and largest quant hedge funds. I built one of the bond market's first [algorithmic trading systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_trading), and headed US investing and operations for Simplex before retiring in 2007.

🎓 I studied Engineering Physics at IIT Bombay, India's top technology school. While there, I helped set up India's first campus data network, and won a bunch of awards, mostly for extra-curriculars and leadership.

### 🎯 Board Roles

I have served on and continue to serve on private company boards.  

Typically, these roles leverage my experience as a successful generalist founder; my deep knowledge of data businesses; my expertise in capital markets; or some combination thereof.  

I'm available for additional board roles if the fit is right.

### 💡 Startup Advisory

I help founders **execute better** through relevant, concrete, actionable advice, delivered with alignment and empathy.

I'm deeply familiar with both the low-level tactical problems and daily grind of running a startup with all its attendant uncertainty and scarcity; and the high-level challenges and imperatives of building a **business that matters** over the long term.  

I'm especially strong on growth strategy; building a world-class team and culture; fund-raising; narrative creation and positioning; and personal development.  My goal is to help you understand **what excellence looks like** in all of these.

### ⚖️ Ethics

While I believe in the ability of markets, data and technology to make the world a better place, I'm also keenly aware of their limitations. 

😑 **Data** can be noisy, messy or incomplete; more dangerously, it can be misleading, biased or falsified.  Not all questions can be answered with data.  High-quality decision-making under uncertainty with imperfect information is hard, and therefore valuable.

🏴‍☠️ **Markets** can be imperfect, incomplete, non-competitive, regulated, corrupt, captured, rigged or otherwise flawed.  Flawed markets lead to information errors, poor incentives and inequitable outcomes.  

💣 **Technology** is vulnerable to incompetence, malice, misuse, indifference, bias and unforeseen consequences.

The optimist (and ex trader) in me says that every inefficiency is an opportunity; the humanist in me cares for the individuals affected by these inefficiencies.  Using data-markets-technology to make the world a truly better place is not easy.  But what better way to spend one's life?

### 🧭 Exploring

I'm currently exploring ideas in the AI/ML space, especially around data, data tools, and data business models. Some things I'm looking at:

💎 Proprietary, latent, golden and small data assets; and how to build, connect and capture value from those assets.

🛠 Data infrastructure, especially tools that help generative models become first-class consumers as well as producers of data.

🤝 Trust hierarchies and the confidence chain: signatures, provenance, identity, curation, quality.

🤖 The compute explosion, software-in-the-loop, ubiquitous agents, matching versus ranking, productivity versus distribution.

🔑 New areas of abundance and scarcity, especially energy, hardware, and "atoms not bits".

If you're working on any of these, I'd love to [hear from you](mailto:at@abrahamthomas.info).

### 📡 Philosophy

The Greek philosopher Anaximenes asked: “Why should I study the stars, when there is suffering and misery here on Earth?”. 

Today, we know the answer.  *The best way to alleviate suffering and misery is through progress.*  Scientific progress to expand the productive frontier; economic progress to balance equity and efficiency; and societal progress to enable not just surviving but thriving.  Studying the stars and investing in the future: that's, ultimately, what I'm interested in.
