## My Work

----

<br/> 

### 📊 Professional Career

I work at the intersection of **data, markets, and technology**. Here are a few things I've done:

🚀 Founded Quandl, a SaaS-enabled B2B marketplace for data. We pioneered the category of [alternative data for finance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_data_(finance)), changing the industry along the way. Quandl was acquired by Nasdaq in 2018 in a successful and substantial exit.  

📈 Early employee at Simplex Asset Management, a quant hedge fund. I built one of the bond market's first [algorithmic trading systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_trading), and headed US investing and operations for Simplex before retiring in 2007.

🎓 Studied Engineering Physics at IIT Bombay, India's top technology school. While there, I helped set up India's first campus data network, and won a bunch of awards, mostly for extra-curriculars and leadership.
