🧭 Here are some things I believe:  
* ABL: Always Be Learning.  
* Every skill is a muscle to be exercised.  
* Changing your mind based on new data is a superpower.  
    - (Most people don't ever change their minds)  
* Speed is under-appreciated in almost every context.  
* Tremendous outcomes require tremendous amounts of hard work.  
    - (Smarts are not enough)  
* Be deliberate, and comfortable with risk.  
    - (Most people are impulsive, and risk-averse)  
* Combine optimism about technology with realism about humanity.  
* If you're not curious, what's the point?  
    - (This is a good filtering function)  
* Be kind, but recognize that kindness has multiple dimensions.  
* Character is grace under pressure.  
    - When the chips are down, who do you want to be?  
* Luck matters a lot, but you can help luck find you.  
* Arguments about means are often actually about variances.  
* Knowing your own preferences is the key to happiness.  
* If you don't blow your own trumpet, it shall remain unblown.  
    - (I struggle with this)  
* Life is too short to play zero-sum games.  
* Do less to do more.  
* Big dreams, sincerity and enthusiasm are all good things.  
* Optimists change the world.
