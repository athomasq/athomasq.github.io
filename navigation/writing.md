### üì° On Startups and Technology

*[Ambition Should Be Made of Sterner Stuff](/sterner-stuff)*  ‚≠êÔ∏è

### üìà On Markets and Investing

*[Alfred Winslow Jones: the Hidden Architect of Modern Markets](/alfred-winslow-jones)*  ‚≠êÔ∏è

Do you let data tell you what to do in toto?  Or is data merely one input into a non-generalizable process that ultimately relies on human judgement?  This, increasingly, seems to be the key divide in active asset management.

I fell into finance by accident. Here's how it happened.

### üìÄ All Things Data

### üß† On Thinking Well


*[A Fine Line Between Stupid and Clever](/a-fine-line-between-stupid-and-clever)*  
Everybody wants to be contrarian these days; they think it makes them look smart. But the thing about being truly contrarian is that it doesn‚Äôt make you look smart. It makes you look dumb.
