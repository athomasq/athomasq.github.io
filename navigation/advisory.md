ðŸš€ I **advise high-growth SaaS and data startups** on execution.

* I help founders execute more effectively, drawing on my years of experience as co-founder of a successful venture-backed startup, plus my subsequent work with dozens of founders as an active and involved angel investor.

* I can help you with almost any tactical or strategic challenge you're facing.  I'm especially strong on growth strategy; building a world-class team and culture; fund-raising; narrative creation and positioning; and personal development. 

I'm currently open to advisory opportunities, but am selective about who I work with.  Learn more on my advising page.
