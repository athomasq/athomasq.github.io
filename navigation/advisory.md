## Startup Advisory

----

<br/>

Startups are all about execution.  I help founders **level up their execution** through relevant, concrete, actionable advice, delivered with alignment and empathy.


### Why Me?

Because unlike most advisors, I've walked the walk, not just talked the talk.  

I'm the co-founder of a successful venture-backed tech startup, and can advise on every aspect of the startup journey: from inception, through multiple phases of growth and financing, all the way to exit and beyond.  

I draw on years of experience in the trenches actually building and selling products, hiring and empowering teams, raising capital and negotiating deals, designing and executing growth strategies, and more -- **as a founder**, not just an operator.  

I remain engaged with the ecosystem and with current best practices through my subsequent work with dozens of founders as a very active and involved angel investor, startup advisor, and venture partner.  

### How I Help

I'm deeply familiar with both the low-level tactical problems and daily grind of running a startup with all its attendant uncertainty and scarcity; and the high-level challenges and imperatives of building a business that matters over the long term.  

Here are a few categories where I have especial expertise:

**Financing:** I'm exceptional at helping startups tell their stories to investors, and orchestrating successful financing rounds.  

**Growth:** I'm adept across a wide variety of B2B growth channels and go-to-market motions, and I help companies devise and then execute the growth approaches that work best for them.

**Team-building:** I help founders understand what excellence looks like for each function and at each stage, so that they can build a truly world-class team.  

**Planning:** I help founders with their resoure allocation decisions, so that they can balance risk and reward, uncertainty and upside, time and money, and thus maximize their odds of success.

**Operations:** I help problem-solve at an extremely granular, day-to-day level, whether those are problems of people, technology, process, or something else. 

**Culture:** I believe culture is every successful startup's secret weapon; I help founders create outstanding organizational cultures with thoughtfulness and intentionality.

**Personal Development:** Being a founder is a long and hard journey, and the best founders level up constantly and consistently.  I can help you with that.

### My Advisory Philosophy

Most advisors are terrible.  They take advantage of inexperienced (and some experienced) founders; they give advice that is not just bad, but actively counter-productive; they waste founder time with irrelevancies; they add friction, confusion, and negative energy. 

I'm not most advisors.  I pride myself on being off-the-charts valuable; and if I'm not, I encourage founders to fire me.

I'm selective about my advisory clients.  I want to spend my bandwidth on companies where I can make an outsized impact; if I don't think I can help you, I won't waste your time or mine.

I typically work with startups between 100k and 10M in revenue: roughly, Seed to Series C, though some of my advisees don't want or need to raise venture capital.  I mostly work with saas, data and marketplace startups; mostly B2B, some consumer; and mostly North America, some Europe / UK.
