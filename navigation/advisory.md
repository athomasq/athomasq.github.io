## Startup Advisory

----

<br/>

Startups are all about execution.  I help founders **execute better** through relevant, concrete, actionable advice, delivered with alignment and empathy.

<br/>

### Why Me?

Because unlike most advisors, I've walked the walk, not just talked the talk.  

* I'm the co-founder of a successful venture-backed tech startup, and can advise on every aspect of the startup journey: from inception, through multiple phases of growth and financing, all the way to exit and beyond.  

* I draw on years of experience in the trenches actually building and selling products, hiring and empowering teams, raising capital and negotiating deals, designing and executing growth strategies, and more -- **as a founder**, not just an operator.  

* I remain engaged with the ecosystem and with current best practices through my subsequent work with dozens of founders as a very active and involved angel investor, startup advisor, and venture partner.

### How I Help

I'm deeply familiar with both the low-level tactical problems and daily grind of running a startup with all its attendant uncertainty and scarcity; and the high-level challenges and imperatives of building a business that matters over the long term.  

Here are a few categories where I have particular expertise:

* **Financing:** I'm exceptional at helping startups tell their stories to investors, and orchestrating successful financing rounds.  

* **Growth:** I'm adept across a wide variety of B2B growth channels and go-to-market motions, and I help companies devise and then execute the growth approaches that work best for them.  

* **Team-building:** I help founders understand what excellence looks like for each function and at each stage, so that they can build a truly world-class team.  

* **Planning:** I help founders with their resoure allocation decisions, so that they can balance risk and reward, uncertainty and upside, time and money, and thus maximize their odds of success.  

* **Operations:** I help problem-solve at an extremely granular, day-to-day level, whether those are problems of people, technology, process, or something else.  

* **Culture:** Culture is every successful startup's secret weapon. I help founders create outstanding organizational cultures with thoughtfulness and intentionality.  

* **Personal Development:** The best founders level up constantly and consistently. I can show you how.  

* **Data:** This hopefully goes without saying, but I am one of the world's leading experts on data business models, data assets, and data defensibility.  If your startup intersects wth those areas, I can help you.

### My Advisory Philosophy

Most advisors are terrible.  They take advantage of inexperienced (and experienced) founders; they give advice that is not just bad, but actively counterproductive; they waste founder time with irrelevancies; they add friction, confusion, and negative energy. 

I'm not most advisors.  I pride myself on being off-the-charts valuable to the companies I serve; and if I'm not, I encourage founders to fire me.

I'm selective about my advisory clients.  I want to spend my bandwidth on companies where I can make a meaningful impact; if I don't think I can help you, I won't waste your time or mine.

I expect to be paid fairly; this helps filter out situations where I don't add enough value, which helps nobody.  My advisory rate is low relative to market standards in SF and NY, and high relative to pretty much everywhere else in the world.  I am happy to be paid in either cash or equity.  

I typically work with startups between 100k and 10M in revenue: roughly, Seed to Series C (though some of my advisees don't want or need to raise venture capital).  I mostly work with saas, data and marketplace startups; mostly B2B, some consumer; and mostly North America, some Europe.
