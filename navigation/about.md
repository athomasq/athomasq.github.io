üß≠ Here are some aphorisms I try to live by:
* Almost every skill is a muscle and can be exercised.
* Changing your mind based on new data is a superpower.
    - (Most people don't ever change their minds)
* Speed is under-appreciated in almost every context.
* Tremendous outcomes require tremendous amounts of hard work.
    - (Smarts are not enough)
* Be deliberate and comfortable with risk.
    - (Most people are impulsive and risk-averse)
* Commit deeply but be flexible; strong opinions, weakly held.
* If you're not curious, what's the point?  
    - (This is a good filtering function)
* Be kind, but recognize that kindness has multiple dimensions.
* Character is grace under pressure.
    - When the chips are down, who do you want to be?
* Luck matters a lot, but you can often make your own luck.
* Combine optimism about technology with realism about humanity.
* Arguments about means are often actually about variances.
* Knowing your own preferences is the key to happiness.
* If you don't blow your own trumpet, it shall remain unblown.  
    - (I struggle with this)
* Life is too short to play zero-sum games.
* ABL: Always Be Learning.
* Do less to do more.
* Big dreams, sincerity and enthusiasm are all good things.
* Optimists change the world.
