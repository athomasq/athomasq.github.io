üöÄ I **advise high-growth software and data startups** on execution.

* I help founders execute more effectively, drawing on my years of experience as co-founder of a successful venture-backed startup, plus my subsequent work with dozens of founders as an active and involved angel investor.

* I can help you with almost any tactical or strategic challenge you're facing.  I'm especially strong on growth strategy; building a world-class team and culture; fund-raising; narrative creation and positioning; and personal development. 

I'm currently open to advisory opportunities, but am selective about who I work with.  Learn more on my [advising page](https://abrahamthomas.info/advisory).

üí° I **advise institutional investors** on data strategy.

* I specialize in helping firms that have historically been more fundamentals-driven in their approach, use data -- especially new sources of data and new use cases for data -- more effectively across every aspect of their investing operations.  

* As a former buy-side portfolio manager at a large quant hedge fund, who then co-founded Quandl, the firm that pioneered "alternative data in finance", I have expert-level knowledge of what it takes to excel as a modern data-driven investor.  

* I work primarily with large public markets investors -- hedge funds, asset managers, pension plans -- but have also consulted across PE, VC, and other asset classes.

üß≠ Here are some **things I believe**:  

* ABL: Always Be Learning.  
* Every skill is a muscle to be exercised.  
* Changing your mind based on new data is a superpower.  
    - (Most people don't ever change their minds)  
* Speed is under-appreciated in almost every context.  
* Tremendous outcomes require tremendous amounts of hard work.  
    - (Smarts are not enough)  
* Luck matters a lot, but you can help luck find you.  
* Do less to do more.  
* Be deliberate, and comfortable with risk.  
    - (Most people are impulsive, and risk-averse)  
* Combine optimism about technology with realism about humanity.  
* Life is too short to play zero-sum games.  
* If you're not curious, what's the point?  
    - (This is a good filtering function)  
* Discipline doesn't restrict your choices, it expands them.  
* Excellence is a habit, and should be cultivated as such.  
* Be unfailingly kind, even when -- especially when! -- it's hard.  
    - But recognize that kindness has multiple dimensions.  
* Character is grace under pressure.  
    - When the chips are down, who do you want to be?  
* Arguments about means are often arguments about variances.  
* Compassion, empathy and courtesy signal strength, not weakness.  
* Knowing your own preferences is the key to happiness.  
* No task is too small to do well.  
* If you don't blow your own trumpet, it shall remain unblown.  
    - (I struggle with this)  
* Big dreams, sincerity and enthusiasm are all good things.  
* Cynics appear smart, but optimists change the world.
