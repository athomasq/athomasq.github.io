üß≠ Here are some aphorisms I try to live by:
* Most people don't ever change their minds; if you can change yours based on new data, it's a superpower.
* Almost every skill is a muscle and can be exercised.
* Speed is under-appreciated, both as a competitive advantage, and as a means of de-risking.
* Tremendous outcomes require tremendous amounts of hard work; smarts are not enough.
* People tend to be impulsive but risk-averse; a better combination is to be deliberate but open to risk.
* Commit deeply but be flexible; strong opinions, weakly held.
* If you're not curious, what's the point?  (This is a good filtering function)
* Be kind, but recognize that kindness has multiple dimensions.
* Character is grace under pressure; when the chips are down, who do you want to be?
* Both success and failure owe more to luck than is generally recognized, especially by the successful.
* The best macro trades combine optimism about technology with cynicism about humanity.
* Many arguments purport to be about means but are actually about variances.
* Knowing your own preferences is the key to a happy and fulfilled life.
* If you don't blow your own trumpet, it shall remain unblown.  (I struggle with this)
* Life is too short to play zero-sum games.
* Do less to do more.
* Big dreams, sincerity and enthusiasm are all good things.
* Optimists change the world.
