Some of you may have noticed: it's been a volatile year for markets.  How does this impact you as a founder?  

Exec summary: this is a good news for you.

More nuanced answer: For founders building "grounded" companies that solve *genuine* customer problems, the volatility may cause some short-term pain, but if you can get through that, it's almost certainly the best thing that could happen for your startup over the long term. 



# Macro backdrop

I'm not going to go into a blow-by-blow of how we got here.  Suffice to say: over the last few years, there was a lot of excess capital in the world, which found its way into most asset classes: public markets, real estate, crypto, and most definitely, early stage tech.  Now that capital is leaving, and those asset classes are feeling the pinch.

Some of this is driven by events in the "real economy" -- the return of inflation, war in Europe, the ongoing impacts of covid and long covid, the great resignation, supply chain whiplash and much more.  And some of it is just a feedback loop -- the reversal of some the dynamics outlined here.

# Effects on venture

Venture funding typically follows public market valuations with a lag.  Public markets peaked in Nov 2021.  IPOs dried up shortly afterward.  Late stage and growth equity fell off a cliff in Q1 of 2022.  Series A and B financing slowed down in Q2.  And now the effects are being felt upstream, at seed stage.

It's not that deals aren't being done.  They are.  Good startups are still getting funded.  But the definition of "good" has changed -- it's no longer about growth at all costs, it's about *efficient* growth -- good unit economics, strong pricing power, low burn, line of sight to profitability. 

The FOMO-driven fund-raising environment of 2021 -- where a fast-growing startup could go from first pitch to multiple term sheets in 72 hours -- is gone.  Investors are taking their time to do proper diligence again, and they're not getting caught in bidding wars.  

# Wait and see

Right now I would say that the vast majority of investors are in wait-and-see mode.

It's not just investors.  A corollary of this is that founders who have the choice, are choosing not to raise.  They'd rather wait for the market to recover, if not to 2021 levels, then at least to 2020.  And VCs, recognizing the adverse selection and balance of power for founders who are running out of cash and hence compelled to raise right now, are pushing valuations down aggressively.Valuations are down anywhere between 25% and 50% even for early stage.


# Consequences


What's going to happen?  Many startups will fail.

Many are unprofitable ane will

The situation is tougher for startups that are okay but not great .  In previous years, they would have receifed it and gone on to succeed; now, 

This is a good thing.  over the last 2 years, the #1 skill for "successful" foudnres was fund-raising.  It didn't matter how good your product, customers, traction,

The question is -- morelike 2009 or morelik 2001.

Venture funding usually lags public market valuations with a lag.  When public markets decline, private markets follow -- moving upstream

- the current shakeup in tech is a good thing and an opportunity for you.
- but don't pay too much attention to the noise, there's always a lot of overreaction in both directions.
- keep doing what you're doing; the best strategy is always to build a good business; you are naturally frugal and careful and those will serve you well.
- your twin goals are: aim to 4x your mrr over the next 12 months (3x minimum, 5x stretch goal), and don't run out of cash.
- it's okay to increase burn a little bit but remember that's a one-way street. if you can get to 4x without spending more than you currently spend, fantastic.  
- keep a close eye on churn and leading indicators of churn.  forward-looking intel from the sales frontline is extra valuable right now.
- in your shoes I would probably raise 150-250k at 6-8M, the dilution is a small price to pay for peace of mind + optionality in both bad scenarios (margin of safety, longer runway to get to breakeven) and good scenarios (things are working, let's spend more on google ads).
