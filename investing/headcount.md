## On Hiring and Headcount

----

*As a founder -- especially if you've just raised a round of financing -- you will come under immense pressure to grow your headcount.  Resist this temptation.*

## Hiring slows you down

One of the key advantages that startups have is that they can move faster than large, established companies.  *It follows logically* that at some point, hiring more people actually slows you down.

This is counter-intuitive.  Most founders understand that the *marginal* contribution of new hires diminishes over time -- your 300th team member is not likely to be as additive as your 3rd.  But they still probably believe that the marginal contribution is positive.  It's not.  

In my experience, the first break point happens around 12 people.  Why 12?  Well, the modal startup has 2 founders.  It's hard to have more than 5-6 direct reports, so once you get to around 12 people, you need to have non-founder leaders.  This instantly introduces a *huge* amount of friction.  

You can no longer take whole-team alignment for granted.  Every piece of communication is now a game of telephone.  You have to worry about politics and perception, reporting lines and boundaries.  People start advocating for process and discipline over ad hoc problem solving.  

To be clear: these are all good things.  You absolutely need non-founder leaders, and process, and discipline, and internal comms.  You can't scale without them.  But they all come at a cost -- in time, and effort, and focus. 

For founders whose only experience is going from 0 to 10 team members (during which phase every hire probably does increase velocity), it comes as a shock (and often a source of intense frustration) when they hire team members 10 to 20 and find that they're actually moving *slower* as a result.  

Needless to say, you should postpone that transition for as long as you can. 


## Hiring kills focus

What happens when you hire, and now have multiple teams, with multiple leads?  You start parallel-processing.

This too is a mistake.  

Focus matters.  In early-stage startups, there are always 10 things that are on fire.  One superpower of successful founders is being able to identify which of those fires are minor kitchen flareups, and which might actually burn down the house -- and then ruthlessly ignoring the former to focus on the latter.

This is hard.  The intellectual part -- distinguishing between minor and major blazes -- is hard enough, but even worse is learning to tolerate the discomfort of seeing a fire go unchecked.  Telling a team member -- or worse, a customer -- "we know that's broken, but we're not going to fix that just yet".  You have to learn to tolerate that discomfort -- and it's really hard especially if you have high standards (which too is a superpower of successful foudners).

So the easy way out is to hire more people so that you can multi-task -- put one team on the mission critical stuff, and another team on all the nice to haves and product polishes and bug fixes.  

This is a recipe 

If it's not existential, don't do it.

## Everybody Wants You To Hire

There is no shortage of people who will advise you to hire -- indeed, who will act as if it is the obvious and natural thing to do.  Why so?

- **Headcount is a traditional marker of success**


- **Headcount is easy to measure**.  Most external observers cannot evaluate your tech, product, customers or traction -- so they fall back on the "easy" proxy that headcount equals progress.  This includes local influencers, the press, your family and your friends.  You don't need to hire in order to impress them.

- **Team members want to become leaders**. In big companies, career progress is often measured by how many people report to you.  Unfortunately, some members of your team will internalize this way of thinking to their own career paths.  Keep this in mind 

- **Investors want you to spend**.

- **Hiring is good for founder ego**.

- VCs have not p

- Investors give you money to grow -- and hiring is the easiest way to spend that money.  



- In big companies, career progress is often measured by how many people report to you.  (Not just in big companies; also in the army, in government, in many service sector jobs).  Unfortunately, many folks transfer this thinking to the startup world, where it is incorrect.  Startups can and should use *technology*, not human labour, to scale.

I'm often asked "how big" Quandl was when we were acquired.  These days, I answer "9 of the 10 biggest hedge funds and 14 of the 15 biggest banks in the world were our customers -- and we were big enough to charge them very high prices".  This impresses them far more than our (relatively small) headcount of 50 -- and it should!
