## On Hiring and Headcount

----

*As a founder -- especially if you've just raised a round of financing -- you will come under immense pressure to grow your headcount.  Resist this temptation.*

## Hiring slows you down

Let's start with a truism: one the key advantages that startups have is that they can move faster than large, established companies.  *It follows logically* that at some point, hiring more people actually slows you down.

This is counter-intuitive.  Most founders understand that the *marginal* productivity of new hires diminishes over time -- your 30th team member is not likely to be as additive as your 3rd.  But they still probably believe that the marginal contribution is positive.  It's not.  

In my experience, the first break point happens around 12 people.  Why 12?  Well, the modal startup has 2 founders.  It's hard to have more than 5-6 direct reports, so once you get to around 12 people, you need to have non-founder leaders.  This instantly introduces a *huge* amount of friction.  

You can no longer take whole-team alignment for granted.  Every piece of communication is now a game of telephone.  You have to worry about politics and perception, reporting lines and boundaries.  People start advocating for process and discipline over ad hoc problem solving.  

To be clear: these are all excellent things.  You absolutely need non-founder leaders, and process, and discipline, and internal comms.  You can't scale without them.  But they all come at a cost -- in time, and effort, and focus. 

For founders who have only experienced going from 0 to 10 team members (during which phase every hire probably does increase velocity), it comes as a shock (and often a source of immense frustration) when they hire team members 10 to 20 and find that they're actually moving *slower* as a result.  

So as a founder, I encourage you to postpone that transition for as long as you can. 

## Hiring kills focus





## Everybody Wants You To Hire

There is no shortage of people who will advise you to hire -- indeed, who will act as if it is the obvious and natural thing to do.  Why so?

- **Headcount is a traditional marker of success**


- **Headcount is easy to measure**.  Most external observers cannot evaluate your tech, product, customers or traction -- so they fall back on the "easy" proxy that headcount equals progress.  This includes local influencers, the press, your family and your friends.  You don't need to hire in order to impress them.

- **Team members want to become leaders**. In big companies, career progress is often measured by how many people report to you.  Unfortunately, some members of your team will internalize this way of thinking to their own career paths.  Keep this in mind 

- **Investors want you to spend**.

- **Hiring is good for founder ego**.

- VCs have not p

- Investors give you money to grow -- and hiring is the easiest way to spend that money.  



- In big companies, career progress is often measured by how many people report to you.  (Not just in big companies; also in the army, in government, in many service sector jobs).  Unfortunately, many folks transfer this thinking to the startup world, where it is incorrect.  Startups can and should use *technology*, not human labour, to scale.

I'm often asked "how big" Quandl was when we were acquired.  These days, I answer "9 of the 10 biggest hedge funds and 14 of the 15 biggest banks in the world were our customers -- and we were big enough to charge them very high prices".  This impresses them far more than our (relatively small) headcount of 50 -- and it should!

- In many traditional organizations (big companies, government, public sector, the army), career progress is measured by how many people report to you.  Unfortunately, many folks transfer this thinking to the startup world.
