### How I Invest

I aim to be an investor who founders trust and can rely on.  This means:

* **Support:** I'm a resource for you beyond just my dollars.
* **Expertise:** I'm happy to share any knowledge I have.  
* **Low ego:** I help if I can, and get out of the way if I can't.  
* **High trust:** I act with integrity and professionalism.  
* **Respect for your time:** Quick responses, minimal friction.
* **No games:** I win when you win.

### What I Invest In

🔮 I invest in startups that are building a future I want to be part of, and I try to help them make that future a reality. Beyond that, there are no rules.

🔥 Team ability and macro trends matter the most to me. Traction is useful but not as important. I don't care who else is investing or on your cap table. 

🌎 I'm flexible on geography, industry, and business model. I prefer B2B to consumer. About half my portfolio is in Canada, and half outside it.

🐶 I like both overdogs with "unfair advantages", and underdogs who are "scrappy, resilient, resourceful". I invest in both "brave new world" startups and "faster better cheaper" startups.

### Why Work With Me?

❤️ **Empathy:** Being a founder is hard. As a founder who has been through the venture-backed journey myself, from inception to exit, I believe I can be more aligned, more insightful, and more empathetic about the challenges you face than most investors without that experience.

🔧 **Execution:** I can help tactically on almost all operational aspects of early-stage startups: go-to-market strategy, sales & marketing; culture & team-building; narrative creation & fund-raising.

🧠 **Knowledge:** There are a few topics that I have specific deep expertise in: data and API business models; capital markets & B2B fintech; starting and scaling network-effects businesses; and building successful data-centric organizations.

🤝 **Networks:** I can help with introductions to potential team-mates, customers, partners, and down-stream investors including many well-known VC firms.

### How I Can Help

I can help on almost all operational aspects of early-stage startups. I’m especially strong on:  

📝 **Story-telling:** The ability to craft a compelling narrative -- for customers, for partners, for investors, for employees, for the press -- is an essential part of the founder's toolkit, and it's something I have a lot of experience with.

🌻 **Go-to-market:** A great product won't change the world unless it's matched with great distribution. And modern distribution is complex: inbound, outbound, bottom-up, top-down, product-driven, sales-driven, community-driven, channel-driven, hybrid -- there are so many interacting options. I can help you navigate them.

👩‍💻 **Recruiting and culture:** The team you build is the company you build. To attract and retain and empower and scale a truly world-class team is perhaps the biggest challenge for founders today. Creating a strong culture is the key to solving this challenge, and it's something I pride myself on.

💽 **Data and API strategy**: I know the modern data ecosystem well, and can help on almost every aspect of data in your organization: business and commercial strategy, infrastructure and technical choices, and team construction and growth.

### Investment Process

I typically reach investment decisions using no more than 2 meetings and 10 days of calendar time.  Here's how it works:

1️⃣ [Connect with me](/contact). I welcome cold emails! Send me a brief intro message along with a **deck or other collateral** of your choice.  

2️⃣ Within 3 business days, I'll either pass, or ask for a meeting. If you don't hear from me in 3 days, I might be off-grid; please send me a nudge.  

3️⃣ We do a **45-minute intro meeting**, in which you: describe the vision, product, company, team, traction, tech, and macro trends (why now?).  

4️⃣ Within 2 business days of our first meeting, I'll either pass, or ask for a second meeting. I may send you some questions or ask for some docs, but I won't ask you to do any substantial new work or prep.  

5️⃣ We do a **60-minute deep-dive meeting** in which I try to understand the opportunity in greater detail.  

6️⃣ Within 3 business days of our second meeting, I'll either pass, or commit to invest.  

I find that this process works well for me, but I'm happy to use a different process if you prefer.
