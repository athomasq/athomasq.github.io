# Investing In Public
### Notes From My First Year As A "Serious" Angel

*"Any idiot with a checkbook looks like a genius right now."* -- [Zach Coelius](https://twitter.com/zachcoelius)  

*"Better to stay silent and be thought an idiot, than to speak out and remove all doubt"* -- [apocryphal](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2010/05/17/remain-silent/)

### Introduction

I've been angel investing, off and on, for close to a decade, but it's only in the last year or so that I've become more intentional and systematic about it.  One aspect of this is more careful measurement of everything I do; and in the spirit of "building in public", I thought I'd share some high-level portfolio stats and commentary.  

The commentary is copious and unfiltered.  Think of it as a combination of an internal memo on process, an investor letter to my sole LP (myself), a documentary and a record of some interesting times.  For the TLDR version with just the stats, [click here](https://abrahamthomas.info/checks-and-balances/).

### Funnel Statistics

Here's what my funnel has looked like over the last 8 months:

(Unfortunately, I didn't keep detailed funnel stats prior to spring 2021.)

I feel like I need substantially more dealflow.  I'd like to reach a state where I see a dozen or more terrific opportunities every year and it genuinely hurts to have to say no to half of them.  I'm not there yet.  I *think* I avoid making mediocre investments just to hit my annual deal goal, but I could be utterly wrong on that; after all, I don't see the deals that I don't see.

### Portfolio Modeling

*"Without thoughtful [portfolio] construction, all you have is a pile of stones"* -- [Jerry Neumann](http://reactionwheel.net), liberally paraphrased

This is perhaps the area where I've evolved the most.  Given power law outcomes, current valuations, capital constraints and risk preferences, how should I structure my portfolio? How many investments a year, what cheque size, which rounds, what valuation ranges, when to follow on, when to exit, what win/loss ratios to target, how to recycle and so on?  There are lot of moving parts. 

So naturally, I built a model and scienced the shit out of it. Here's where I ended up:

I now have a framework that imposes some degree of investment discipline.  I think this has been the biggest single change in my approach in recent times.

### Picking Investments

Should I select companies to invest in based on team, or product, or market?  I'm a big fan of Andy Weissman's answer: **why choose?**  

Nobody's forcing me to invest, so I should be willing to pass on deal after deal until I find one that has a great team *and* a great product *and* a great market.  Anything else is a compromise.

What about traction?  Well, at the valuation ranges I invest, startups rarely have any traction worth mentioning.  Besides:

*"The dirty secret is that there is no such thing as traction pitches anymore. Because as every company knows -- the best days are always yet to come."* -- [Kevin Kwok](https://kwokchain.com/2021/09/29/narrative-distillation-1/)

### Revealed Preferences in Company Selection

After writing the above, I went back and scored my actual portfolio on a number of factors: team, market, product, macro trends, biz model, traction and valuation.  I also scored companies that I passed on after doing deep dives, to see what factors influenced my cut. 

*image*

Empirically, it appears that I care about **team, market and macro** the most; product and biz model slightly less; and traction and valuation the least of all.  I thought I'd be pickier on business model, but it appears that I have faith that strong teams in big markets supported by powerful trends will figure it out.  Revealed preferences ftw!

### Entry Valuations

Early-stage investing in 2021 is all about navigating the tension between two opposing truths:

* value investing does not work in venture;
* it's hard(er) to make money investing at high(er) valuations. 

My median entry valuation for pre-seed and seed rounds has increased every year, and I'm totally okay with that; I think it's a sign of strength.  I'd be much less sanguine investing in an asset class where valuations declined every year.

### Getting Allocation

I've participated in 22 financing rounds so far: 15 first cheques and 7 follow-ons.  9 of those 22 rounds have been competitive / oversubscribed.  But I've been able to get my full target allocation in every financing I've participated in.


*image*

There are probably a few reasons I'm able to get into every deal I bid on: 
* the general scarcity of angel investors in Canada; 
* my own credibility as a successful tech founder; 
* my knowledge of AI-data-API and NFX businesses; 
* co-investors and VCs who vouch for me; 
* the small size of my cheques;  
and so on.  

But the *biggest* factor is probably my dealflow, or rather lack thereof.  Chances are, my win rate is high because I'm not even at the table for the most competitive rounds. 

So paradoxically, I'd like this particular stat to worsen: I'd like to have my money rejected a few times!

### Post-Investment Support


I tell founders: "I try to help if I can, and get out of the way if I can't."  So far this seems to be working okay.  Most of my portfolio founders have reached out to me at some point to chat about or think through a particular problem they're facing.

On average I spend 2-3 hours with each of my portfolio companies every 2-3 months.  The topics which come up most often are go-to-market, narrative creation, culture, recruiting and team structure, and financing strategy.

### Portfolio Performance

So far, all of this seems to be working well.  My angel portfolio is currently at a multiple of 1.8 and an IRR of 157%. 

Here's my performance sliced by year of deployment: 

<img src="/assets/img/irr-table.png" class="image">

I've invested in 15 startups over the last 2Â¼ years. None of them are dead yet.  As of Dec 2021, 7 out of 15 have raised further funding.  This percentage correlates with company vintage, as expected:

So far the distribution of individual-company markups seems to follow a power law reasonably closely:

Excluding my best-performing company from the calculations still results in an IRR of 111%.  Truly, a rising tide lifts all boats!

### My Actual Portfolio

My companies are the best.  

My editor (me) says I should probably write a little more about them, so [here's a list](/portfolio-detailed).  For each company I've also included the category, a brief description, and some reasons why my investment committee (also me) picked them.

<br/>


### Portfolio Decomposition

Here are a few different ways to slice my portfolio.

- By geography: 

<img src="/assets/img/slice-geography.jpg" class="image3">

I aim for 60-40 within and outside Canada, so this is mostly on track.  I tend to avoid Bay Area startups: too much competition, not enough edge.  I'd like to make more investments in obscure parts of the world.

- By deal source: 

<img src="/assets/img/slice-channel.jpg" class="image3">

I think this is slightly above average on cold inbound.  Over time, I expect "pre-existing personal network" to diminish, but I'm hoping that cold inbound and warm intros both grow in parallel.

- By founder demographic:

<img src="/assets/img/slice-founders.jpg" class="image3">

At a high level, 21 of 30 portfolio founders come from an underrepresented slice.  But it's mostly immigrants and minorities; not enough women.  It has not escaped my notice that I'm an immigrant minority man, so this almost certainly reflects my own network and biases.  I need to do better.

- By business model: 

<img src="/assets/img/slice-category.jpg" class="image3">

Listing them out like this, it does seem that "anything goes", as long as it's B2B or at best B2B2C.  I'm not sure this is wise; maybe I'd do better specializing?

### Anti-Portfolio

There's two types of anti-portfolio: companies you pass on, and companies you don't even see.

As far as I know, I have not passed on any startup that's gone on to be super successful, though of course it's early days yet.  This is in fact the strongest indictment possible of my dealflow.  My picking is good, but it can't be *that* good.  The implication of no big misses is that I'm not seeing enough high-quality companies. 

On the other side, I don't really care about false positives.  I expect 50% of my companies to lose every dollar, and a further 25% to lose most of it.  The fact that so far this has not happened is perhaps a bit concerning -- either my calibration is off, or I'm not investing in risky-enough startups, or the market is unsustainably supportive.  (Or it could just be too soon; lemons ripen early but my portfolio is earlier still.)

### Motivation and Goals

Going through this exercise helped me examine my own motivations for angel investing.  Why am I even doing this?  There are 3 main reasons:

* **Macro thesis**: Tech is taking over the world.  I'm a tech optimist and I believe we're still really early in tech's adoption across industries and geographies.  I want to be part of that ride. 

* **Micro thesis**: I think I have certain structural advantages as an angel investor.

* **The real reason**: I enjoy it, it's intellectually stimulating and emotionally rewarding, I think I can actually make a difference, and maybe even make some money.  

It turns out you can put those 3 reasons neatly into an Ikigai-ish framework:

I think that's a good note to end this review on!

### Further Reading

If 2000 words and 12 graphs aren't enough for you, here are some extra jottings that my editor (still me!) cut from this essay:

* Why invest in public?
* Finding an edge as an angel investor
* How big should an angel portfolio be?
* Dealflow quantity versus quality
* Second-order effects in portfolio math
* Navigating high valuations 
* Optimal loss rates in picking and winning
* Precursor portfolio performance
* Different models of founder support
* Areas for improvement
* Knowing what I don't know

If you've read this far, wow.
