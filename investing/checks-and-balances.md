# Checks and Balances
### My Angel Investing Year In Review, 2021

*Why even have an angel portfolio if you can't draw pretty pictures with it?*

### Investing in Public

I’ve been angel investing, off and on, for close to a decade, but it’s only in the last year or so that I’ve become more intentional and systematic about it. One aspect of this is more careful measurement of everything I do; and in the spirit of “building in public”, I thought I’d share some high-level portfolio stats and commentary.

### Funnel Statistics

Here's what my funnel has looked like over the last 8 months. (Unfortunately, I didn't keep detailed stats prior to this spring.)

<!-- 96 deals seen, 41 initial calls, 14 deep dives, 6 yes (GEKRPT) -->

These 6 investments join the 8 investments I made in the preceding 2 years, giving me a portfolio of 14 companies.

### Portfolio Construction

I've become a lot more deliberate about portfolio construction in recent months.  Here's the framework I try to follow:

### Company Selection

I did a (post facto, completely subjective) scoring of my portfolio companies.  Empirically, it appears that I value team quality, market size and macro trends the most; and traction very little.

### Getting Allocation

Roughly half the financings I've participated in have been competitive / over-subscribed.  Despite this, I've always managed to get my full target allocation in each deal.

### Entry Valuations

My median entry valuation for pre-seed and seed rounds has increased every year.

Note that I invested in a couple of higher-valued post-seed rounds in 2021, which are excluded from the above.

### Portfolio Decomposition

Here are a few different ways to slice my portfolio.

By business category:

By geography:

By source:

By founder demographics:

### Portfolio Performance

7 out of 15 companies have raised subsequent financing at a markup.  Here's a table showing markups and IRR by year of investment.

Of course, it can't be emphasized enough that these numbers are mostly meaningless, given the short timespans involved.

### Outcome Distributions

I aim to achieve a power-law-ish distribution of terminal outcomes, like this:

Here's the distribution of individual-company markups so far:

So far, so good.
