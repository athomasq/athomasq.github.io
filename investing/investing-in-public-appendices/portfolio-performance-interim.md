## Portfolio Performance -- Interim Report

As of Dec 2021, my angel portfolio is currently at a blended multiple of 1.8x. 

Here's my performance sliced by year of deployment:

As of Dec 2021, 7 out of 15 have raised further funding.  This percentage correlates with company vintage, as expected:

So far the distribution of individual-company markups seems to follow a power law reasonably closely:

Excluding my best-performing company from the calculations still results in a multiple over 1.5x.  

Of course, I cannot emphasize enough how early my portfolio is -- far too early to draw any meaningful conclusions.  Time will tell if my seemingly strong performance is sustainable, and real.
