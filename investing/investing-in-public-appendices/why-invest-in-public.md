# Why Invest In Public?

Lots of people build in public, sharing the ups and downs of the founder journey.  Far fewer invest in public.  

Why is that?  A mix of reasons.  There's reputation: failure is not a badge of honour for investors the way it can be for founders. There's competition: the market is awash with capital, so why give away your secrets to your rivals?  And there's reticence: being able to angel invest is a privilege, and many don't want to flaunt that.

The exception of course is the all-too-common humblebrag when a company exits: "Proud to be an investor in Acme Corp, IPOing today."  Typically, there's no mention of *when* the person made their investment, or in what size, or how many investments they had to make in order to find one Acme Corp.

A final factor is that most angels have declining perfomance over time.  This is just survivorship bias.  Angels whose first few investments fail, quickly stop being angels.  Only those who struck gold early on remain in the game; and since part of *every* gold strike is luck (no matter how good the prospector), there's likely to be reversion to the mean.  

The result of all these dynamics is a truly horrendous amount of selection bias in public angel profiles.  Angels who fail don't talk about it; angels who have a true edge don't talk about it; and all that's left are the angels who <strike>got lucky</strike> are smart and would like you to know it.

So I thought I'd do my small bit to remedy that, by documenting my own angel investing progress in real time.  Maybe I'll do well, maybe I'll do badly, but in either case, I'll try to present an unvarnished view.
