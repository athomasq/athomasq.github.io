4. Is 45% a touch low?  It's nice to invest in companies nobody else believes in, but is that being contrarian, or simply being wrong?  Note that the value of being contrarian in inefficient markets like venture is not clear; startups are not like public stocks.

At the same time, I wouldn't want 100% of my deals to be competitive; that would suggest the opposite, viz. that I'm not being contrarian enough, and also that I'm paying too much.  I think something like 66% competitive, 34% contrarian would be an ideal level to shoot for.  (I have no data to support this assertion).
