1. My goal is to make 6-8 investments a year, and so far I seem to be on track, but it's a lumpy process.  2 investments on the same day (!) in June, none from July to September, 2 in October, 3 in November.  Should I expect a steady cadence, or is lumpiness part of the game?  Does dealflow follow a Poisson process?

2. One interesting question is, how big does the top of my funnel need to be to support this?  Presumably an investor who sees 200 companies has better odds of finding 6 excellent ones than an investor who sees just 20.  But does one who sees 2000 do even better?  Does quantity imply quality?  At what point do diminishing returns set in?  Is there a point where the marginal value turns negative?  How much is just circularity (the best investors attract the best companies, and also more of the worst)?  

Intuitively I feel like if I invest in say 1 out of every 50 companies I see, I should end up with a pretty good portfolio, but it's not completely obvious.  (I'm currently at 1 out of every 15, more or less.)  

At any rate, one of my goals for 2022 is to double or triple my dealflow.  I have some ideas on how to do that.
