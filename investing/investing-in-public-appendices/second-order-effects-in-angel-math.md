# Second Order Effects In Portfolio Construction

----

For me, the most useful part of building a detailed model of my angel portfolio was not the numbers in the model, but rather, getting an intuition of how those numbers interact.  Understanding how my outcomes vary with respect to changes in market assumptions or my behaviour.  

Some pieces are very robust, others very sensitive; some effects are very linear, some not so.  I knew these facts in the abstract, but seeing them explicitly modeled out was illuminating.

For instance:

* The more the variance around your hit rate, the more companies you need in your portfolio.

* The more power-law your outcomes, the more important it is to follow on in your winners.  
* Pre-committing to a set number of investments over several years allows you to invest all through the cycle.

* If you double your entry valuations, you need to double your exit valuations, but only for your big winners; the losers have minimal impact either way.

* Time to exit doesn't matter much; it only changes your IRR.  If you're investing your own money, you don't really care about IRR, only about MOIC.

Once written out, these conclusions seem obvious, but the exercise of modeling them out was valuable (to me at least).
