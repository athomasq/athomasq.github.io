# My Edge As An Angel Investor

----
*If you don't know the mark at the table, it's probably you.*

I spend a lot of time thinking about edge -- it's been one of the defining themes of my professional career.  I now have a clearer sense of where my edge is, and it comes down to three facts:  

* Most investors have no founder experience.
* Most founders turned angels have no investing experience.
* Most institutional investors have bad incentives.

Let's break those down:

**Founder Experience:** At early stage, team is everything, and I think my experience as a successful venture-backed founder myself gives me a clear edge in evaluating other founders.  Venture-backed tech startups are not the same as other businesses, pitching well is not the same as executing well, and being a founder is not the same as being an operator or investor.  

**Investor Experience:** I think my pre-angel experience -- a decade as a portfolio manager at a large hedge fund, and another decade parsing the data signatures and business drivers of public companies while running Quandl -- gives me a degree of analytical clarity beyond most angels without a professional investing background.  

**Incentives and Alignment:** I'm not answerable to LPs; I have none.  This means I don't have to waste time on "accountability theatre", nor do I have to care about headlines, hot deals, artifical IRR horizons, or fund-raising in general.  It also means I can truly align myself with my portfolio founders; I don't have other customers to please.  This makes a difference. 

I suspect it's easy enough to find angels with any two of these attributes, but the intersection of all three is rare.
