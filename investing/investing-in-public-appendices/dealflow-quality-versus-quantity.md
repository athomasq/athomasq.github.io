# Quantity Versus Quality Of Dealflow

----
*"Ninety percent of everything is junk."* -- Ted Sturgeon ( Sturgeon's Law).

My goal is to make 6-8 investments a year, and so far I seem to be on track, but it's a lumpy process.  2 investments on the same day (!) in June, none in the next 4 months, then 5 in the next 4 weeks.  Should I expect a steady cadence, or is lumpiness part of the game?  Does dealflow follow a Poisson process?

One interesting question is, how big does the top of my funnel need to be to support this?  Presumably an investor who sees 200 companies has better odds of finding 6 excellent ones than an investor who sees just 20.  But does one who sees 2000 do even better?  At what point do diminishing returns set in?  Is there a point where the marginal value turns negative?  How much is just circularity (the best investors attract the best companies, and also more of the worst)?  

The other interesting Does quantity imply quality? 

The burute force method 

But  

List yourself as an angel investor on LinkedIn, Twitter and elsewhere, and you will get plenty of cold emails, but do you want those?

On average, warm intros and in-network connections are likely to deliver higher quality.  But I don't care about averages, I care about outliers.  (I also strongly agree with )
The key is increasing quantity without degrading quality.

Intuitively I feel like if I invest in say 1 out of every 50 companies I see, I should end up with a pretty good portfolio, but it's not completely obvious.  (I'm currently at 1 out of every 15, more or less.)
