# My Edge As An Angel Investor

This essay is verbose, opinionated and self-indulgent, but it has its flaws as well.  

I'm an experienced investor in public markets and I know a fair bit about running startups, but I'm not a professional venture investor.  This puts me firmly in the Dunning-Kruger danger zone for this stuff.  

Some of what I hypothesize is likely to be obvious; and some of it is likely to be flat out wrong.  I'm trying hard not to be a tourist or trend-chaser, but it's hard to disentangle skill, luck, unsustainable market dynamics, and genuine macro trends.

None of the data in this essay is remotely statistically significant.  I wouldn't advise drawing any sort of conclusions from my process, portfolio, or results so far.  (Except my general awesomeness of course).

I probably contradict myself a dozen times in these notes; partly because I don't believe consistency is necessarily a virtue for investors, and partly because I don't know all the answers, so this is just me thinking out loud.
