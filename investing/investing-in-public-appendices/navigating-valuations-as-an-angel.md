## Navigating High Valuations As An Angel

----

*Yes, what the world needs is another hot take on tech valuations.*

### Introduction

Valuations, as any fule kno, have been going up across the board.  What does this imply for portfolio construction?  

I believe that two things can be true at the same time: valuations are rising for reasons that are mostly legitimate, and it's hard(er) to make money investing at high(er) valuations.

Let's start with the reasons.  Here's what I believe:

### Tech has huge unrealized upside

* Tech is eating every industry, and we're still in the early stages of market penetration.  (The canonical example here is US e-commerce: it's still [less than 20%](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/ECOMPCTSA) of retail sales.  That's only going to go up.  And there's a whole world out there beyond the USA.)  There's a lot of value remaining to be created and captured as this transition continues.

* There's an abundance of capital looking for profitable opportunites (especially given ZIRP and QE and friends), and much of it will be allocated to tech as it eats up more of the world.

* As a result, terminal outcomes for tech startups are at least 2 orders of magnitude larger than almost anyone had ever anticipated.  And this propagates upstream, to the earliest stages of venture investing.

* If inflation is here to stay, tech is a really good hedge. 

### Value investing does not work in venture

The next thing I believe is that "value investing" does not work in venture:

* Many markets tend to be winner-takes-most, thanks to network effects, data loops, self-fulfilling prophecies, system-of-record stickiness, and narrative control. 

* Venture building has matured to the point that it's easier than ever to identify the top 1% or 10% of companies likely to succeed in any given market.

In this world, buying startups on the cheap usually means buying startups that are unlikely to deliver large outcomes.  Conversely, almost no price is too high to pay for the truly exceptional companies.

The challenge is seeing and getting a chance to invest in those exceptional companies on a consistent basis.  It's one thing if you're Benchmark, Sequoia, A16z or Tiger Global.  It's another thing entirely if you're a relatively low-profile angel investor in Toronto. 

And if you don't pick the best of the best, the math is [extremely challenging](https://avc.com/2021/11/seed-rounds-at-100mm-post-money/). 

So how do I square this circle?  I have a few methods that work for me.  

### Invest early

The first is to swim upstream and invest "hilariously early", to use Hustle Fund's memorable phrase.  If the team, market and macro trends are strong, I don't care that the product is rudimentary, the business model is vague or the traction is non-existent.  I suspect most investors are not quite like that.

### Think different

The second method is identifying startups where the founder, market, product and business are all great, but they fall into VC blind spots.  Data businesses, saas-enabled marketplaces, and a few other hybrid models often fall into this category; so do startups helmed by women, minorities, recent immigrants, and people outside the big-city/known-school tech networks.  The best of them don't stay in that category long.

### Be smarter

I mean, there's no efficient-markets way to put this: just be smarter than others.  

[Incidentally, these methods analogize nicely to meta-strategies that I'm familiar with from my time as a hedge fund investor.  Investing in blind-spot startups is just persistent-cognitive-bias arbitrage, and investing early is just risk-preference arbitrage.  To a quant with a hammer, everything looks like a nail.]

My markups so far suggest that this approach is working, but you can't eat markups.
