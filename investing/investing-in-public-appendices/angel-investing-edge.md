# My Edge As An Angel Investor

----
*If you don't know the mark at the table, it's probably you.*

I spend a lot of time thinking about edge -- it's been one of the defining themes of my professional career.  I think most markets are *efficient enough* that without an edge (and a corresponding investment philosophy + discipline), it's very hard to make money.

Yet when I first started angel investing, I wasn't entirely sure where my edge would be.  Would it be industry knowledge?  Connections and networks?  Domain expertise?  Quantitative skills?  Something else?

I now have a much clearer sense of where my edge is, and it's none of those.  Instead, I think my edge comes down to three facts:  

* Most investors have no founder experience.
* Most founders turned angels have no investing experience.
* Most institutional investors have imperfect incentives.

Let's break those down:

**Founder Experience:** At early stage, team is everything, and I think my experience as a successful venture-backed founder myself gives me a clear edge in evaluating other founders.  Venture-backed tech startups are not the same as other businesses, pitching well is not the same as executing well, and being a founder is not the same as being an operator or investor.  

**Investor Experience:** I think my pre-angel experience -- a decade as a portfolio manager at a large hedge fund, and another decade parsing the data signatures and business drivers of public companies while running Quandl -- gives me a degree of analytical clarity beyond most angels without a professional investing background.  

**Incentives and Alignment:** I'm not answerable to LPs; I have none.  This means I don't have to waste time on "accountability theatre", nor do I have to care about headlines, hot deals, artifical IRR horizons, or fund-raising in general.  It also means I can truly align myself with my portfolio founders; I don't have other customers to please.  This makes a difference. 

I suspect it's easy enough to find angels with any two of these attributes, but the intersection of all three is rare.

Of course, any discussion of edge should also include anti-edge, and I have some of that as well
