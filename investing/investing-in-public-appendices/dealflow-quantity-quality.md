# Quantity Versus Quality Of Dealflow

----
*"Ninety percent of everything is junk."* -- Ted Sturgeon (Sturgeon's Law).

My goal is to make 6-8 new investments a year.  How big does the top of my funnel need to be to support this?  Presumably an investor who sees 200 companies has better odds of finding 6 excellent ones than an investor who sees just 20.  But does one who sees 2000 do even better?  At what point do diminishing returns set in?  

More fundamentally, does quantity imply quality?  List yourself as an angel investor on LinkedIn, Twitter and elsewhere, and you'll get plenty of cold emails from founders, but are those the emails you want?  It's not clear.

On average, I've found that warm intros and in-network connections are likely to deliver higher quality companies to me.  But here's the thing -- I don't care about averages, I care about outliers.  (This blog post by Del Johnson perfectly captures the way I feel about warm intros; I'll take them, but I want to take ice-cold connections as well.)

Is there a point where the marginal value of new leads turns negative?  Pitch fatigue, information overload, cognitive capture, trend immersion -- these are all real things.   Perhaps seeing too many deals actually degrades your judgement.  

Where's the sweet spot?  If I had to guess, higher than 150 companies a year (my current level), but lower than 1000 (the number that many VCs quote).  Not unrelated, I find that too many VCs are jaded and overworked and hence default to meta-analysis aka following the herd.

Do good deals follow a Poisson process?  Certainly my own investing has been rather lumpy: 2 investments on the same day (!) in June, nothing for the next 4 months, then 5 in the next 4 weeks.  Should I expect a steady cadence, or is lumpiness part of the game?  Is there anything to be gained from trying to time-smooth my investing intra-year?  (Multi-year, it makes sense, because of valuation regimes: I want to invest all through the cycle, both ups and downs.)

Intuitively I feel like if I invest in say 1 out of every 50 companies I see, I should end up with a pretty good portfolio, but it's not completely obvious.  (I'm currently at 1 out of every 15, more or less.)  

Fun questions to ponder!
