## Constructing a Coherent Angel Portfolio

*"Without thoughtful [portfolio] construction, all you have is a pile of stones"* -- [Jerry Neumann](http://reactionwheel.net), liberally paraphrased

This is perhaps the area where I've evolved the most.  My first few angel investments were ad hoc and unsystematic; there was very little science or rigour behind how much, or when, or where I invested.  As a result, I think my portfolio was definitely less than the sum of its parts.

So this year I spent some time thinking about how to create a performant and internally consistent portfolio.  Given power law outcomes, current valuations, capital constraints and risk preferences, how should I structure my investing? How many investments a year, what cheque size, which rounds, what valuation ranges, when to follow on, when to exit, what win/loss ratios to target, how to recycle and so on?  There are lot of moving parts. 

So naturally, I built a model and scienced the shit out of it. Here's where I ended up:

I aim to achieve a power-law-ish distribution of terminal outcomes, like this:

I now have a framework that imposes some degree of investment discipline.  More than anything else, it helps me be internally consistent, across time and across companies.  I think this has been the biggest single change in my approach in recent times.
