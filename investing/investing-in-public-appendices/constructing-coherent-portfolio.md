# Constructing a Coherent Portfolio

*"Without thoughtful [portfolio] construction, all you have is a pile of stones"* -- [Jerry Neumann](http://reactionwheel.net), liberally paraphrased

This is perhaps the area where I've evolved the most.  Given power law outcomes, current valuations, capital constraints and risk preferences, how should I structure my portfolio? How many investments a year, what cheque size, which rounds, what valuation ranges, when to follow on, when to exit, what win/loss ratios to target, how to recycle and so on?  There are lot of moving parts. 

So naturally, I built a model and scienced the shit out of it. Here's where I ended up:

I now have a framework that imposes some degree of investment discipline.  I think this has been the biggest single change in my approach in recent times.
