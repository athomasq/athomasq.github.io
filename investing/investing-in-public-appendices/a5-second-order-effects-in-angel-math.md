second order effects

3. What I found every bit as useful as the target numbers themselves was understanding their derivatives with respect to various changes in market assumptions or my behaviour.  For example:

* the more the variance around your hit rate, the more companies you need in your portfolio.
* the more power-law your outcomes, the more important it is to follow on in your winners.  
* pre-committing to a set number of investments over several years allows you to invest all through the cycle.
* if you double your entry valuations, you need to double your exit valuations, but only for your big winners; the losers have minimal impact either way.

Once written out, these conclusions seem obvious, but the exercise of modeling them out is valuable (to me at least).
