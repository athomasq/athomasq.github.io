What I'm still trying to figure out is whether this pull-based, problem-driven interaction is optimal, or if I can be more effective by being more proactive.  The challenge is to add that proactivity without projecting an unearned authority or a certainty that doesn't exist.  (Yes, this is pompous).  Ideally I'd like to apply the same transform to value-addition that I've done to portfolio construction: make it less ad hoc, and more intentional.

The other thing which I'm still working on is the balance between supporting founders with advice and encouragement, and pushing founders to do more, move faster, aim bigger.
