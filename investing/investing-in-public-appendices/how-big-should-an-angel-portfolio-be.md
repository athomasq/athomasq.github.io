# How Big Should An Angel Portfolio Be?

----

Bigger than you think; so much bigger, in fact, that most people should not be angel investors.  The math is inexorable.

Let's work it out.

Most tech startups fail.  All the returns from venture investing come from the small fraction of companies that don't.  A *good* investor typically has just 1-2 successes out of every 10 investments.

Unless you have reason to believe you'll be not just good, but *excellent* at picking companies -- and by "reason to believe" I don't mean gut feeling or wishful thinking, I mean solid empirical evidence -- you shouldn't expect a higher hit rate than 1 in 10.

So does that mean you need 10 companies in your angel portfolio?  No, you need at least 2-3 times that, because of variance.  With just 10 companies, you're too sensitive to a single miss: one bad decision can sink you.  If you had 100 companies instead, a couple of bad decisions would see you at 8 wins out of 100, and a couple of lucky ones could see you at 12 out of 100 -- either way, you're still at close to that 10% hit rate.  Variance around your hit rate argues for a larger portfolio; it's just a large-numbers effect.

You need at least 20, and preferably closer to 30-40 investments in a *minimal* angel portfolio.  

The next problem is cheque size.  If you're investing directly into the cap table, most founders want a minimum investment of at least $10k in most parts of the world (and 2-5x that in the Bay Area).  Syndicates and rollup vehicles alleviate this somewhat, but now you're paying (non-trivial) fees on your investment.  (Where are the customers' yachts?) 

So if you plan to make 25 initial investments of $10k each, that's $250k.  But wait, we haven't talked about follow-on cheques yet.  The most common reserve ratio is 1:1, though some investors (notably Roger Ehrenberg at IA) argue that you should follow-on at 3x the size of your initial investment.  Even with 1:1, you now need $500k; with 1:3, it's $2M.  

But let's be conservative and assume you never follow-on, even though that probably doesn't maximize returns.  Does that mean that $250k in liquid assets is what you need to be an angel investor?  Possibly, but that leaves you zero liquidity and zero margin for error and zero diversification.  

Angel investments are illiquid; you won't get your cash back for many years (if at all).  So it's not enough to have $250k (or whatever the amount is) of capital; you must have $250k of capital that *you don't need* and indeed are perfectly comfortable with losing.  For most people, that translates to 10-20% of their net worth.  

(Note also that many angel investors have day jobs in the tech industry, so this is not exactly a channel for macro diversification.)

So -- assuming the minimum portfolio size (25 cos.), and the minimum cheque size ($10k), and zero follow-ons, and the maximum sector allocation (20%), you need over a million dollars in liquid, investable cash, to even *think* about serious angel investing.

If you're not at those numbers, you can still angel invest of course, but you should treat it differently; not as a sustainable or predictable source of portfolio returns, but as a way to learn new things, meet new people, finance new tech, and in general be part of building the future you want to see.
