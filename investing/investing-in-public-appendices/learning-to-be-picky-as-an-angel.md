title: Learning To Be Picky As An Angel

## The Right Kind of Risk

*The way of the successful investor is normally to do nothing -- not until you see money lying there, somewhere over in the corner, and all that is left for you to do is go over and pick it up.* -- Jim Rogers

*"Oh, picky, picky, picky"* -- Hamm, Toy Story 2

Should I select companies to invest in based on team, or product, or market?  I'm a big fan of Andy Weissman's answer: **why choose?**  

Nobody's forcing me to invest, so I should be willing to pass on deal after deal until I find one that has a great team *and* a strong value prop *and* a huge market.  Anything else is a compromise.

This fits with the Jim Rogers / Hamm school of thought.  Pickiness is a virtue for angels.

One objection is that if I wait for the perfect pitch, I'll never swing.  Venture investors should worry more about false negatives than false positives; you can only lose your money 1x on a failure, but passing on a unicorn can cost you 10x or 50x or even more.  You miss 100% of the shots you don't take.

Another objection is that the ingredients of a perfect pitch are fairly obvious, and so those valuations will be bid up, negating any selectivity advantage.  Maybe Union Square's reputation allows it to get into such deals at reasonable prices, but that doesn't apply to me.

I think both objections are legitimate, but solvable.  It's subtle though.

Early stage companies are by definition imperfect.  There are always gaps and flaws, unknowns and uncertainties.  These imperfections are in fact the reason angel investors like myself can invest at low valuations and reap excess rewards; if those imperfections did not exist, valuations would be a lot higher.

The trick, I'm increasingly beginning to realize, is to accept *the right kind* of imperfection.  Or equivalently, to take the right kind of risk: what quant traders refer to as *"compensated risk"*.

I want to bet on factors that can change, such that with those changes, the value of the company goes up.  I *don't* want to bet on things that can't be changed.

Team, market/macro, and business-model/product-value-prop are hard to change.  So I want to back companies that already have these; I *don't* want to take a risk here.  This takes care of the first objection: empirically, it's rare for a startup without a great team AND great market/macro tailwinds AND a great business-model/value-prop to deliver outlier success, so I'm not missing out by insisting on these attributes.  (Though of course, I still have to *identify* these attributes correctly.)

Meanwhile, traction, competition, names on the cap table -- these are all things that can and will change over time, and as they change, I expect valuations to rise.  I'm happy to take a bet on these factors, in the knowledge that I'm being compensated for the risk I'm taking.  And this takes care of the second objection: by investing in copmanies that don't have strong signals on these dimensions, I'm getting discounted valuations.




(But if I were investing at later stages, I would totally be a traction + narrative investor) 

It's difficult and unlikely for startups without a great team AND great market/macro tailwinds AND a great business-model/value-prop to deliver outlier success.  

I don't mind investing in a company with early or minimal traction.  If traction subsequently picks up, the valu of the company wil go up; I've been compensated for the risk I took.

I *love* investing in companies with unfashionable or underappreciated foudners.  If my judgement is right and the founders succeed, again the value of the company will go up.

But I don't want to invest in a copnay with an unproven product or business model.  Even if I'm tight, what do I get?


Betting on a mediocre team is an uncompensated risk.  Even if you're right, you don't get any extra reward for it.  

The same goes for betting on 

So you shouldn't "bet" on team, or product, or market: you should go for certainty.

But betting on traction, or competition, or is a compebsated risk.


Let's assume that there are a certain number of factors that go into evaluating an investment: team, traction, product, market, technology, macro trends, competition, price.  I used to

What about traction?  Well, at the valuation ranges I invest, startups rarely have any traction worth mentioning.  Besides:
