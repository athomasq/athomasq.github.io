## Investor Update Examples

*Here's an example of a concise investor update email:*



### Summary

This is Acme Corp's update for Feb 2022.  As a reminder, Acme Corp provides widgets-as-a-service to the gizmo industry.

It was a good month for the business, with all indicators moving in the right direction.  We sold our first multi-coloured widget.


### KPIs

**North star:** widgets-per-month: 314,159 (+10%)  
**MRR:** $24,300 (+12%)  
**Gross burn:** $28,000 (+6%)  
**Cash in bank:** $82,000  
**Baseline runway:** 20 months (constant burn and MRR)  
**Projected runway:** 33 months (burn and MRR grow as forecast)  


### Specific Updates

**Good:** The core widget business is doing well.  Pipeline from our end-of-year campaign continues to convert.

**Bad:** It took a lot longer than expected to build multi-coloured widgets.  We are trying to learn how we can do better with the next launch.  


### Asks

Some customers are asking about widget insurance contracts, bundled with the service delivery.  I'd love to talk to anyone who has experience or input on that.

#### TLDR

This is Acme Corp's update for Feb 2022.  As a reminder, Acme Corp provides widgets-as-a-service to the gizmo industry.

We had a good month on revenue and usage, but lost one big pipeline prospect.  The product feels more mature and I'm now thinking about our next set of hires and our series A process in Q4 of thie year.

*Comment: This is the exec summary.  Keep it short and sweet.  The investor should, at a glance, be reminded of who you are, and be able to tell if the business is green, amber or red.*  


#### KPIs

**Widgets per gizmo (north star):** 314,159  
(+15% month over month, +12% avg last 3 months, +170% year over year)

**MRR:** $24,300 (+$2,000, +12% mom, +8% avg l3m, +120% yoy)  
**MRR drivers:** $1400 new, $900 upsell, -$300 churn  

**Headcount:** 4 not including 2 founders  
**Gross burn:** $28,000 (+$1,500, +5% mom, +3% avg l3m, +35% yoy)  
**Net burn:** $3,700  

**Cash in bank:** $80,000  
**Runway-baseline:** (assuming constant MRR, constant burn) 23m  
**Runway-projected:** (assuming MRR and burn both grow at l3m avg) 34m   


*Comments on KPIs:*

*As you can see from the template, I like to report 4 "groups" of metrics: business north star, revenue, expenses, and runway.  For each metric, I also like having their mom, l3m and yoy growth rate: they're important to establish trajectory.  The numbers don't have to be exact to the last dollar, but should be reasonably close.*  

*Even if your sales cycle is long, I still like reporting these numbers once a month. You lose too much granularity with quarterly reporting.*

*If you have recurring revenue -- and most of you do -- please report MRR. If you have annual contracts, report them as ARR/12.  Don't include services revenue or non-recurring revenue; report them separately. If you're a marketplace, report GMV and net revenue instead.*

*As far as possible, avoid cumulative numbers, they're just less informative.*  

#### Business Update v1


**Good:** We signed a channel partnership with the Sirius Cybernetics Corp.  Hoping to get lots of high-quality leads from this.  The initial economics are merely okay, not great for us, but we're treating this as an experiment to find out if it works, not trying to optimize yet.

**Bad:** Tessier-Ashpool decided not to purchase.  This was a large opportunity ($150k) and we spent a lot of time on it.  They say they like the product and we were their first choice, but they're under a company-wide freeze on new software contracts.  Will check in quarterly and try to reopen in Q1 2023.

**On my mind:** How can we shorten our sales cycle? 

*This is the section where you talk about the health of the business as a whole.  For the most part, this comes down to customer traction -- sales, pipeline, feedback etc.  One approach is to break this down into "good", "bad" and "on my mind", as above.  Another way to organize this section is by topic: "sales", "strategy" etc., like this:*

#### Business Update v2

**Sales**: We closed two new mid-market deals for 2k and have another 5k in qualified leads.  Going to conferences is working well as an acquisition strategy.  Still trying to figure out how to shorten our sales cycle.  On the flip side, we lost one big prospect due to budget constraints at their end.

**Strategy**: Customer feedback is that they find it hard to widgetize their gizmos.  So we're experimenting with a two-step gtm motion: self-serve PLG for the gizmos, and then a more sales-driven, hand-holding approach for the widgetizing.  One macro challenge here is the global widget chain situation; a micro challenge is that gizmos are somewhat unfashionable at the moment.  

*This is also where you talk about market conditions, business strategy, and other "big picture" stuff.  This should be the section you spend the most time writing.*  


#### Sectional Updates

*After the big picture, business as a whole, strategic update, the next part could be -- optionally! -- a sectional update.*

*You don't need to write detailed reports for every section of the business every single month, but it's good practice to cover each of them every now and then -- again, for your own benefit as much as for investors.  And of course there are times when specific parts of the biz need attention and input, so it's worth calling those out.*

*As always, be candid about both wins and challenges.  Here's an example of a team update:*  

#### Team Update

Had to fire 1 of our 3 engineers – code quality just wasn’t good enough.  This puts even more of a load on our remaining 2 engineers, and so dev velocity has slowed. 

On my mind: Does it make sense to replace the fired engineer with another engineer?  The product is in a reasonably good place; should we spend the resources on sales and marketing instead?  Or do both?  How does this interact with the current funding and valuation environment?  

Also: the fired engineer passed all our technical interviews and evaluations, but couldn't deliver in the real world.  What can we do to avoid this happening in the future?  Would love feedback from anyone who has scaled high-performance engineering teams. 

Our team is now 7 strong: 2 founders, 2 engineers (down from 3), 1 designer, 1 sales, 1 ops.  We plan to hire 1 more sales person for sure; debating whether to replace the lost engineer, or substitute with another gtm person.

*Other sectional updates could be on product, team, marketing, market/industry, and pipeline.  Some of the topics you could consider including in each of these sections:*

*Product: gaps, roadmap, customer feedback, pricing*  
*Team: hires, fires, gaps, productivity, org structure, culture challenges*  
*Sales & Marketing: campaigns, tactics, motion, funnel metrics, efficiency*  
*Finances: runway, fund-raising, unit economics, deeper dive on metrics*  
*Market: competition, ecosystem, macro trends, moats and strategy*  

*Here's an example of a pipeline update, which is useful to share if you sell to enterprise.*


#### Pipeline Update

Stage|Count #|Amount $|Win Prob %|Weighted $
TOFU Leads:|120|$120,000|5%|$6,000
Sales-Qualified:||||
Demos:||||
Proposal Sent:||||
Negotiation:||||
Total:||||



#### Asks

*This is where you ask for help -- tactical or strategic advice, introductions, feedback, you name it.  I personally welcome lots of asks, the more the merrier, but I've seen some other investors advise putting just your 2-3 highest priority requests; I leave that to you.  Here are some example asks:*

Currently planning to begin our Series A process in 9 months.  What do I need to do today to prepare?  

Right now I'm the only person closing sales, and I will run out of bandwidth by Q3.  So I need to bolster the team.  What profile do you think would be ideal for us as the first sales hire -- Director or VP of Sales, senior AE, junior BD or SDR, CS rep, something else? -- and how should we go about finding such a person?



#### Optional Sections

*Here are some sections you can occasionally include.  But don't feel obliged to include all of this every month -- that just creates extra work for you.*  

*Education: useful articles about the space you're in, to educate your investors (a constant process!)*  
*Company news: awards, news articles, any other social proof*  
*Shareable content: eg blog posts or other thought leadership by your team*

*As you can see, the verbose version is quite verbose -- almost like a board pack.  I would NOT advise writing all of this every single month -- that doesn't seem like the best use of your time and effort.  But I'm sharing all of this to give you a sense of the possibilities -- you should use your own judgement to select the parts that convey the most effective picture of the business, to maximize the value you then receive from the readers (investors).*
