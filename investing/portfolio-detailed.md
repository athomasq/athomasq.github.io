## My Angel Portfolio in Detail

----

<br/>

As of Dec 2021, here are the 14 companies I've invested in, and why I invested:

----
<br/>

### <center>2019</center>

🧠 **[Daloopa](https://www.daloopa.com/)** [AI] -- AI-driven data extraction and inference for financial back offices.  Invested because I like the premise of using modern ML techniques to automate processes that are hugely costly and time-consuming for Wall St (and other) firms.

🏢 **[Mero](https://mero.co/)** [Infrastructure] -- Sensors, data and software for smarter, cleaner buildings.  Invested because of strong capital efficiency, stickiness of solution, potential wedge into high-value data and analytics, and straightforward portfolio gtm.

### <center>2020</center>

🌏 **[Terra.do](https://terra.do)** [Climate] -- climate community, education platform and job market.  Invested because it's a big and important idea with a huge surface area, and they have a ridiculously high NPS. 

🖥️ **[Setyl](https://www.setyl.com/)** [SaaS] -- asset, device and subscription management software for offices.  Invested because it's a simple and light-weight solution to a widespread problem, with natural growth channels. 

🏫 **[Canopy](https://www.canopyanalytics.com/)** [SaaS] -- reporting software for multi-family property managers.  Invested because it's a classic deployment-era play: bringing modern data and software functionality to a fairly staid industry.

🏡 **[BuyProperly](https://buyproperly.ca/)** [Fintech] -- Amazon meets Robinhood for home ownership: a marketplace for fractional shares of property.  Invested because they've solved lots of hard and unglamorous back-end problems to make the magic work; also terrific founder-market fit and plenty of pent-up demand.

🏗️ **[Citylitics](https://citylitics.com/)** [Infrastructure] -- data-as-a-service business covering every type of physical infrastructure.  Invested because they've put years of effort into creating a valuable and unique data asset, and are now poised to reap the rewards.

🤝 **[AcuSpire](https://www.acuspire.ai)** [AI] -- AI-driven software to generate better job *matches* (not just searches through listings or resumes).  Invested because I believe this is the next logical step in the evolution of job platforms; also, their enterprise offering is a great solution to the marketplace cold-start problem.

💡 **[Getware](https://www.getware.ai/)** [AI] -- AI-driven insights from unstructured customer interactions, surfaced and summarized at scale for product teams.  Potential customer described this to me as a "no-brainer" purchase if it works as advertised and I agree.

🚚 **[Erly](https://www.geterly.com)** [Logistics] -- Amazon-Prime-as-a-service for D2C merchants.  Invested because of a terrific value prop for merchants and a neat business model.  *Update Jan 2022:*  The founder decided that market and macro conditions were unfavourable, and returned cash to investors. 💀

💵 **[Requity](https://www.requityhomes.com)** [Fintech] -- Rent-to-own for people who can't get a mortgage despite strong cashflow.  Invested because of strong founder-market fit, neat 2-sided business model, underserved but large market, and it makes the world a better place.

⛵️ **[Paysail](https://paysail.us)** [Crypto] -- Using crypto rails to enable nearly instantaneous, nearly free B2B payments.  Invested because of "problem-solution fit" -- there are many ways to do payments, but this one just feels *correct* in its elegance.  

🎲 **[TriplePlay](https://tripleplay.ai)** [Workplace] -- A better way to socialize remotely.  Invested because of strong macro trends and a belief that human beings connect through play.

🥷 **Stealth** [Fintech] -- watch this space. 

<!--


💳 **[Klanto](https://www.klanto.com)** [Fintech] -- Spend management platform covering cards, payments, reconciliation and much more.  This is a pure execution play in a crowded space, and I'm betting on an underdog team with scrappiness, hustle and ingenuity.

🛒 **[Arima](https://www.arimadata.com)** [AI] -- Using synthetic data to create rich audiences that are privacy-compliant by construction.  Invested because it's the perfect intersection of founder, market, macro, research, tech and traction.
