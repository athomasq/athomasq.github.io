## Concise Investor Update

### Summary

This is Acme Corp's update for Feb 2022.  As a reminder, Acme Corp provides widgets-as-a-service to the gizmo industry.

It was a good month for the business, with all indicators moving in the right direction.  We sold our first multi-coloured widget.


### KPIs

**North star:** widgets-per-month: 314,159 (+10%)  
**MRR:** $24,300 (+12%)  
**Gross burn:** $28,000 (+6%)  
**Cash in bank:** $82,000  
**Baseline runway:** 20 months (constant burn and MRR)  
**Projected runway:** 33 months (burn and MRR grow as forecast)  


### Specific Updates

**Good:** The core widget business is doing well.  Pipeline from our end-of-year campaign continues to convert.

**Bad:** It took a lot longer than expected to build multi-coloured widgets.  We are trying to learn how we can do better with the next launch.  


### Asks

Some customers are asking about widget insurance contracts, bundled with the service delivery.  I'd love to talk to anyone who has experience or input on that.
