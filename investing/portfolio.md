### Legacy Portfolio: 2015-2017

Between 2015 and 2017 I invested in 9 startups in India:

📺 [AdSparx](https://www.adsparx.com/)  
☀️ [Claro](https://www.claroenergy.in/)  
🔬 [Doxper](http://doxper.com/)  
🏘️ FastFox  
🌐 [i2e1](https://i2e1.com/)  
🚛 [Locus](https://locus.sh/)  
🧰 Qyk  
👁️ [Vue](https://vue.ai/)  
💊 [Wellthy](https://wellthytherapeutics.com/)  


These companies have gone on to raise further funding from Sequoia, Tiger Global, Falcon Edge, GIC and others. As of September 2021, my investments are at a 5.5x TVPI and 42% IRR, putting them in the 97th percentile of comparable portfolios.

### Portfolio Notes

🌱 All the above investments were done at what would today (late 2021) be considered pre-seed stage: very early product with minimal or zero revenue.

🧭 I invest only where I think I have an edge, in either dealflow or evaluation.  As a consequence, my portfolio tends to skew non-Bay Area, mostly B2B, and mostly under-represented or atypical founder profiles.

🎯 I invest my own money.  This gives me a very different objective function from many (most?) startup investors. 


<!--
In addition to investing directly in startups, I am an LP in and advisor to [GrowX Ventures](http://www.growxventures.com/), who I believe to be India's best seed-stage venture capital firm.
