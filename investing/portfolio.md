### Portfolio Notes

🌱 All the above investments were done at what would today (2022) be considered pre-seed stage: very early product with minimal or zero revenue.

🧭 I invest only where I think I have an edge, in either dealflow or evaluation.  As a consequence, my portfolio tends to skew non-Bay Area, mostly B2B, and mostly under-represented or atypical founder profiles.

🎯 I invest my own money.  This gives me a very different objective function from many (most?) startup investors. 

😎 My portfolio companies have gone on to raise further funding from Sequoia, Tiger Global, Falcon Edge, GIC and others. 


<!--
In addition to investing directly in startups, I am an LP in and advisor to [GrowX Ventures](http://www.growxventures.com/), who I believe to be India's best seed-stage venture capital firm.
