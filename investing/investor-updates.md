## Investor Updates FAQ

----

*Quandl did not send out regular investor updates until after our Series A.  This is one of my greatest regrets as a founder -- a huge missed opportunity.  I advise you not to make the same mistake.*

<br/>

#### Why should I send investor updates?

Good investor updates accomplish two things: they are a management tool for your own benefit, and they help establish your credibility with investors.

The exercise of writing a *good* update every month forces you to understand your business really well.  You'll be forced to identify, track and report your key metrics, and also what's driving them.  Following this over time gives you perspective and also helps with priorities -- what's important, what's just noise, what's working, what's not, etc etc.  Re-reading old investor updates is a good way to recognize and celebrate your own progress, and also recognize persistent challenges (which you can then fix.)

(Note that a *bad* update does not accomplish any of these things.  If you find that you're not getting value out of the process of writing your updates, it's probably a sign that your update game needs work.)

Investor updates are also important to establish your credibility with investors.  Now, it's possible that some of your investors are "passive capital" -- they've written a cheque, and that's that -- you don't expect them to help much in the future.  But ideally at least some and hopefully all of your investors are people who can help you at some point -- with strategic or tactical advice, or with intros to follow-on investors, or with further investment themselves.  So it's worth spending some effort to keep them in the loop and happy and excited about your company's progress.  And also be transparent about challenges -- nothing establishes trust like transparency.


#### How often should I send out investor updates?

I recommend sending out investor updates once a month, shortly after the beginning of the month.  Quarterly is too infrequent (things change faster than that) and weekly is too frequent (too much of a burden on founders, and you miss the forest for the trees).

The key is to not take too much time writing your updates.  A 3000-word email that arrives on the 20th of the month is not as useful (for either investors or founders) as a brief summary that arrives on the 1st or 5th.  In steady state you should be able to produce and send this email in less than 1 hour of your time.  (The ROI of that 1 hour is very high). 


#### How candid should I be in my investor updates?

The single most common mistake I see is that founders treat their investor updates as a continuation of their investor pitch.  As a result the updates become completely uninformative -- no honest discussion of problems, too much jargon and abstraction, too much focus on unimportant stuff or vanity metrics.  THIS DOES NOT ESTABLISH CREDIBILITY.

I get it; some amount of pitching is natural and maybe even necessary.  Even with investors, you still want to put your best foot forward.  But if your updates are full of irrelevant verbiage while skirting around actual issues, your investors *will* recognize it, and more likely than not, write you off as a founder in denial.  

The other reason to be candid is simply this: investors want to help.  They can't help if they're not informed.  If you have to brief them from scratch every time you ask for something, it's ineffecient and leads to low-quality help.  It also precludes "serendipitous" help -- eg. an investor reads your update, and although there's no explicit ask, they reach out because something in there sparks some thoughts that might be relevant.  

My favourite founder update in recent times began like this: *"Well, [REDACTED] was a pretty crap month."*  That kind of honesty builds a lot of trust.  (This same founder emailed investors recently to raise a small bridge round, and closed it in less than an hour!)


#### What should I include in an investor update?

You should include your KPIs, a summary of the business, and your asks.  Here's a template that I like to use:

<br/>
<br/>

----

This is Acme Corp's update for Feb 2022.  As a reminder, Acme Corp provides widgets-as-a-service to the gizmo industry.

<br/>

#### KPIs

**Widgets per gizmo (north star):** 314,159  
(+15% month over month, +12% avg last 3 months, +170% year over year)

**MRR:** $24,300 (+$2,000, +12% mom, +8% avg l3m, +120% yoy)  
**MRR drivers:** $1400 new, $900 upsell, -$300 churn  

**Headcount:** 4 not including 2 founders  
**Gross burn:** $28,000 (+$1,500, +5% mom, +3% avg l3m, +35% yoy)  
**Net burn:** $3,700  

**Cash in bank:** $80,000  
**Runway-baseline:** (assuming constant MRR, constant burn) 23m  
**Runway-projected:** (assuming MRR and burn both grow at l3m avg) 34m   



*Comments on KPIs:*

*As you can see from the template, I like to report 4 sets of metrics: north star, revenue, expenses, and metrics.  The numbers don't have to be exact to the last dollar, but should be reasonably close.*  

*If you have recurring revenue -- and most of you do -- please report MRR. If you have annual contracts, report them as ARR/12.  Don't include services revenue or non-recurring revenue; report them separately. If you're a marketplace, report GMV and net revenue instead.*

*As far as possible, avoid cumulative numbers, they're just less informative.*  

<br/>
<br/>

#### Business Update

*This is the section where you talk about the health of the business as a whole.  For the most part, this comes down to customer traction -- sales, pipeline, feedback etc.  I like breaking this down into "good", "bad" and "on my mind", like this:*

**Good:** We signed a channel partnership with the Sirius Cybernetics Corp.  Hoping to get lots of high-quality leads from this.  The initial economics are merely okay, not great for us, but we're treating this as an experiment to find out if it works, not trying to optimize yet.

**Bad:** Tessier-Ashpool decided not to purchase.  This was a large opportunity ($80k) and we spent a lot of time on it.  They say they like the product and we were their first choice, but they're under a company-wide freeze on new software contracts.  Will check in quarterly and try to reopen in Q1 2023.

**On my mind:** How can we shorten our sales cycle?  


<br/>

#### Product Update / Team Update / Finances Update

*Up to you which of these sections you want to include -- you may not need to include all of them every single month.  Some of the topics you could consider including in each of these sections:*

*Product: gaps, roadmap, customer feedback, competition, pricing*  
*Team: hires, fires, gaps, productivity, org structure, culture*  
*Finances: runway, fund-raising, deeper dive on metrics*  

*As always, be candid about both wins and challenges.  Here's an example of a team update:*  


#### Team Update

Had to fire 1 of our 3 engineers – code quality just wasn’t good enough.  This puts even more of a load on our remaining 2 engineers, and so dev velocity has slowed. 

On my mind: Does it make sense to replace the lost engineer with another engineer?  The product is in a reasonably good place; should we spend the resources on sales and marketing instead?  Or do both?  How does this interact with the current funding and valuation environment?  


### Asks

*This is where you ask for help -- tactical or strategic advice, introductions, feedback, you name it.  I personally welcome lots of asks, the more the merrier, but I've seen some other investors advise putting just your 2-3 highest priority requests; I leave that to you.  Here are some example asks:*

Currently planning to begin our Series A process in 9 months.  What do I need to do today to prepare?  Do you have any metrics on benchmarks, valuations etc?

Right now I'm the only person closing sales, and I will run out of bandwidth by Q3.  So I need to bolster the team.  What profile do you think would be ideal for us as the first sales hire -- senior AE, junior BD or SDR, CS rep, something else? -- and how should we go about finding such a person?

#### What should I NOT include in an investor update?

I sometimes see founders send "marketing updates" -- aimed at their customers -- to their investors.  Don't make this mistake; these are two completely different things.  

Some founders are hesitant to include revenue and other KPIs in their updates.  Personally, I find that an update without revenue, growth, burn and cash rates is of very limited utility -- it doesn't help me understand the "health" of the business (performing brilliantly, at death's door) and without that understanding, it's hard to offer good, calibrated advice.  So I do advise including them.  But if it makes you feel better, put a disclaimer saying "confidential, please do not share".  

(Ultimately, it comes down to how much you trust your investors.)

I wouldn't include any valuation numbers or fund-raising target numbers in an investor update -- remember, your future investors may (and often do) ask for all your letters as part of their diligence, so be thoughtful about that.

Also don't include anything that is truly secret sauce.  Most investors won't understand or care. 


#### I've never sent updates in the past, and feel awkward about starting now.  What should I do?

Don't overthink it.  Just add a line at the beginning saying: "Although we haven't done so in the past, we'll be sending regular monthly updates from now on.  Here's the first one."  And don't feel obliged to fill in your investors on the last 6 or 12 or 18 months of progress.

#### Are there any exceptions to the above guidelines?

These guidelines are for pre-seed and seed stage companies.  Once you've raised a Series A and have a formal board, all of this becomes obsolete. (But many of the habits you develope via these updates will serve you in good stead at that time).
