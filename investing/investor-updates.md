## Investor Updates

----

I recommend sending out investor updates once a month, shortly after the beginning of the month.  Here's my preferred template.

This is Acme Corp's update for Feb 2022.  As a reminder, Acme Corp provides widgets-as-a-service to the gizmo industry.


### KPIs

**North Star: Widgets per gizmo:** 314,159  
(+11% mom, =7% avg last 3 months)

**MRR:** $24,300 (+$2,000 = +12% mom, +8% avg l3m)  
**MRR drivers:** $1400 new, $900 upsell, -$300 churn  

**Headcount:** 4 not including founders  
**Gross burn:** $28,000 (+$1,500 = +5% mom, +3% avg l3m)  
**Net burn:** $3,700  

**Cash in bank:** $50,000  
**Runway assuming constant MRR, constant burn:** 13 mos  
**Runway assuming MRR and burn both grow at l3m avg:** 21 mos   



### Business update

**Good:** We signed a channel partnership with the Sirius Cybernetics Corp.  Hoping to get lots of high-quality leads from this.  The initial economics are merely okay, not great for us, but we're treating this as an experiment to find out if it works, not trying to optimize yet.

**Bad:** Had to fire 1 of our 3 engineers -- code quality just wasn't good enough.  This puts even more of a load on our remaining 2 engineers, and so dev velocity has slowed.  

**On my mind:** Does it make sense to replace the lost engineer with another engineer?  The product is in a reasonably good place; should we spend the resources on sales and marketing instead?  Or do both?  How does this interact with the current funding and valuation environment?

### Product update

Despite the loss of an engineer, the product feels like it's finally getting there.  Still some bugs and debt to iron out, so we're going to spend some cycles on that instead of new features.

### Team update

See above re engg.  The good news is that the remaining team is really good -- motivated, productive, happy.  Thinking about what our next 3 hires should be, amnd when.

### Asks

Currently planning to begin our Series A process in 9 months.  What do I need to do today to prepare?  Do you have any metrics on benchmarks, valuations etc?

As always, would appreciate intros to big players in the gizmo industry -- CHOAM Corp, Weyland-Yutani, Tessier-Ashpool etc.

### Commentary

#### Metrics

As you can see from the template, I like to report 4 sets of metrics: north star, revenue, expenses, and metrics.

The numbers don't have to be exact to the last dollar, but should be reasonably close.  The key is not to take too much time putting this together -- a 3000 word email that arrives on the 20th of the following month is far less useful to investors, and far more consuming of your time, than a brief summary that arrives on the 1st or 2nd.  

If you have recurring revenue -- and most of you do -- please report MRR. If you have annual contracts, report them as ARR/12.  Don't include services revenue or non-recurring revenue; report them separately. If you're a marketplace, report GMV and net revenue instead.

#### Logistics

In steady state you should be able to produce and send this email in less than 1 hour of your time.  (The ROI of that 1 hour is very high).  Also, ideally these emails end up having 4 different audiences -- current investors, team members, future investors, and yourself.   


#### Goals

Good investor updates accomplish two things: they are a management tool for your own benefit, and they help establish your credibility with investors.

Investor updates are an excellent management tool.  The exercise of writing a *good* update every month forces you to understand your business really well.  You'll need to identify, track and report your key metrics, and also what's driving them.  Following this over time gives you perspective and also helps with priorities -- what's important, what's just noise, what's working / not working, etc etc.

Investor updates are also a really good way to establish your credibility with investors.  Now, it's possible that some of your investors are "passive capital" -- they've written a cheque, and that's that -- you don't expect them to help much in the future.  But ideally at least some and hopefully all of your investors are people who can help you at some point -- with strategic or tactical advice, or with intros to follow-on investors, or further investment themselves.  So it's worth spending some effort to keep them in the loop and happy and excited about your company's progress.

That being said -- and this is an important point -- the single most common mistake I see is that founders treat their investor updates as a continuation of their investor pitch.  As a result the updates become completely uninformative -- no honest discussion of problems, too much jargon and abstraction, too much focus on unimportant stuff or vanity metrics.  THIS DOES NOT ESTABLISH CREDIBILITY.

I get it; some amount of pitching is natural and maybe even necessary.  Even with investors, you still want to put your best foot forward.  But if your updates are full of irrelevant stuff while skirting around actual issues, your investors *will* recognize it, and more likely than not, write you off as a founder in denial.  

My favourite investor update in recent times began like this:

*"Well, August was a pretty crap month.  We tried this, this and this, and none of it worked.  Other stuff is taking too long.  I have some ideas here and here."*

That kind of honesty builds a lot of trust.

Quandl did not send out regular investor updates until after our Series A.  This is one of my greatest regrets as a founder -- a huge missed opportunity.  I advise you not to make the same mistake.
