I fell into finance by accident.  Growing up, I wanted to be a scientist -- either astrophysics, or biotech -- Carl Sagan or Jurassic Park.

This in itself was an unusual option for a middle-class kid in 1990s India.  Engineering, medicine, law, accountancy -- these were the "safe" choices, and that was my family: my father was a doctor, my mother taught high-school English, I had 3 uncles who were engineers and 3 others who were lawyers.  

And that might have been me.  I was accepted into India's top medical school, and also into India's top engineering school.  (I've always been good at competitive exams).  But I took the path somewhat less trodden; I joined IIT Bombay, but instead of mechanical or electrical or chemical or civil engineering, I chose to major in physics.  A career in academia beckoned.

I was in for a rude awakening.  I quickly realized that there was a world of difference between liking physics as a subject, and doing physics as a career.  I simply didn't have the singlemindedness required to be a successful academic.  I also lacked the patience to do a 5-year PhD followed by multiple post-docs that would hopefully lead to a tenure-track job.  To this day, quantum mechanics, classical mechanics and statistical mechanics remain some of the most beautiful intellectual constructs I have ever come across, but a physics career was not for me.

Disillusioned with academics, I threw myself into extracurricular activities and student leadership. I was institute general secretary, on the core group for [Mood Indigo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mood_Indigo_(festival)), helped launch the first [TechFest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Techfest), and set up India's first campus internet.  I also won a bunch of awards and competitions.

But when it was time to graduate, I found myself at a loose end. While my departmental classmates were winning scholarships to Stanford and Princeton and MIT and Yale and Cornell and Caltech, I entered my senior year completely at a loss for what to do next.  I was accepted into IIM Ahmedabad, then as now India's top business school (there's that competitive exam thing again), but I didn't really want to go there;  I wanted to leave the cloister and experience the world.  At the same time, the types of entry-level positions available to newly minted engineers -- management tracks at large Indian corporates, software development for offshore IT firms -- didn't seem terribly appeaing.


And that's when serendipity struck.  I was offered a very strange job via a strange set of circumstances.  The company making the offer was called Simplex Capital, they were 6 people (I would be the 7th), and they were setting up a "hedge fund" with a small pool of money.  They were based in Tokyo -- !!!! -- but one of their principals had family in Bombay, was connected to me, and offered me a rather vague role as a "quant odd jobs person".

Now you have to remember that this was the mid 1990s.  At the time, hedge funds were still a rather obscure corner of finance; they had none of the glamour (or notoriety) they have today.  Quantitative investing was in its infancy; firms like Citadel, D E Shaw, Millennium and AQR were just a few years old, while others like Winton and Two Sigma hadn't yet been launched.  Most people didn't know a hedge fund from a hedgehog. 

It was doubly hard given that I was in India.  The country was just emerging from 40 years of soft socialism.  Markets were either moribund or corrupt; people who worked with money were looked at with either suspicion or disdain.  The best universities in India produced excellent graduates, but unlike the Ivies or Oxbridge, there was no pipeline linking them to the analyst-associate-VP-MD path on Wall Street.

Not helping matters was the fact that I was utterly clueless about finance.  I didn't know the difference between a stock and a bond; I had only the faintest grasp of macroeconomics; and I confess that I too looked upon the business of money with a mixture of suspicion and disdain.

On the other hand -- Simplex sounded so cool!  They explained their business as  "building mathematical models of the market, and then profiting if those models were correct".  To me that was the future, right there.  No more 

My friends thought I was nuts.  To give up IIM-A, to give up safe job offers at known-brand ompanies ,only to join a tiny little firm that nobody had heard of, in an industry that nobody knew anything about, in a country I'd never been -- 

But to me these were all bonuses.  New horizons!  It was an adventure.  What's the worst that could happen?  They'd fire me, or I'd quit -- no big deal; I'd coe back to India,  I'd get to see Japan.  In the supreme confidence of youth, I was sure that if I hated it, or if they hated me, i would quit, come home, write the b-school admission tests again, and breeze through.  (I later realized how arrogant this was).



So in August of 1998, knowing no Japanese and knowing nothing about finance and barely knowing how to code, I hopped on a plane to Tokyo to take up a new job programming financial models for a Japanes hedge fund.

I loved it.  

I started out as a true quant odd jobs -- everything from data entry (manually transcribing bond prices from broker emails) to SQL queries to yes, fetching sandwiches and coffee for the traders.

Eventually I started doing some front office work: 


The best part was that since the firm was so young, we had to build everything from scratch, and so I was \

We were building infra from scratch so

One day I woke up and realized I hadn't written any production code in over a year; I was now a full-fledged portfolio manager.

I was good at it too!  The same skills that helped me ace exams -- an analytical mind, calmness under pressure, and the sense that this was all game -- helped me .  (I think my childhood experience of war and invasion and ref gave me some perspective on the stakes; sure it was millions of dollars, but it was only money.)

I ended up going from junior trader to senior trader to head of trading.  At one point the opp set in Japan was limted so I started looking at the US treasury market -- the most liquid, the most eyeballed market in the world, and ground zero for a great many quant strategies.  (think liar's poker, when genius failed).  If you can make money trading treasuries, you can do it anywhere.  (think masters of the universe from bonfire).  

And then, of course, I walked away.  Read about that here.

Taking the plunge served me really well.

Being open to serendipity. 

That was what gave me the courage to quit the hf industry cold turkey, a decade later.

<br/>


I fell into finance by accident.  After graduating from university in the late 1990s, I was (somewhat serendipitously) offered a job as a quant-analyst-programmer-odd-jobs-person at a hedge fund.  At the time hedge funds were not as famous (or notorious) as they are now, and I hardly knew the difference between a stock and a bond, but the idea of building mathematical models to predict the market sounded amazingly cool, so I took the plunge.

This was an extremely contrarian move at the time!  Most of my classmates 

But the idea 

I loved it.  I programmed other people's models, then created models of my own, then built systems to trade those models, then began trading them myself, and eventually I found myself a full-fledged portfolio manager.  I started out in fixed income arbitrage, then branched out into long-short relative value and global macro.  I was pretty darn good at it too.


Tody of course hedge funds are very different.  Evyrbody knows about them; they're gamous, notorous.  Hit television shows are made abou them.  

Back then, it was very different.  It was tan incredibly obscure field.  More so in India -- a country jst emnerging from socialism -- we knew nothing of finance.
