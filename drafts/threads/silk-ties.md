*This is a true story.*

<br/>

One day in [redacted], a senior trader at a certain investment bank walked on to the trading floor carrying a suitcase.  

He opened it up to reveal several hundred designer silk ties -- Hermes and Zegna and Armani and Ferragamo and more. 

"My wife says I need a complete wardrobe refresh.  So I've decided to sell all my ties.  The reserve price is set at $20 per tie.  Let the bidding begin".

Traders started calling out their bids.  $40 for the blue paisley Charvet!  $50 for the gold Brioni!  It got exciting. 

One of the rising stars of the trading floor, a young math whiz with a reputation for extremely aggressive risk-taking, jumped up on to a desk.  

"I'll buy the entire suitcase for $100 per tie, all or nothing". 

"Done!" said the senior trader. 

The ties retailed for north of $250 each so this was an amazing bargain, but it was also chunky: the total outlay was close to $30,000, real money in those days.  All the losing bidders were envious and impressed.

The next day, the bank announced they were switching to a casual dress code: ties were no longer compulsory. 

Oops.

<br/>

The senior trader gathered all his juniors and associates and analysts.  

"What did we learn today, boys and girls?"  

"First, we learned to be aggressive.  If you want to do a trade, do it!  Don't fuck around with $20 here and $50 there."  

"Come in with an offer they can't refuse.  You don't win if you're not bold.  Kudos to [X] for being bold and winning the deal." 

"Second, we learned that not all deals are worth winning.  If a trade looks too good to be true, it probably is."

"Your counterparties aren't idiots.  Ask yourself, why are they doing this trade?  What do they know that I don't?"

"In this case, it's pretty obvious: I'm on the management committee, you're not.  I knew about the new dress code, you didn't." 

"Never trade against someone who has better information than you.  Our tie policy is a regulatory constraint, and sometimes regulations change."

"Having a good model of fair value is meaningless if there's a macro regime switch." 

It's a lesson well learned -- even at the cost of $30,000 and a suitcase full of worthless ties!
