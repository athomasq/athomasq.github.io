Network effects exist in time not just space.
Think on-demand services: food delivery peaks at lunch and dinner, documents mid-morning, coffee mid-afternoon, groceries evening.
If you can get them all on one network (whether Uber or Postmates or Shyp or Amazon) you smooth out demand for your couriers.
High constant demand => better economics => more couriers => lower prices + better fulfillment => high constant demand.  Loop complete.
And this is independent and accretive to the classic geographic density network effect best exemplified by Uber.
This is why all the on-demand players are encroaching on each other's turf. UberEATS, AmazonFresh, GoogleExpress, Postmates/Walgreens.
It's not a land-grab driven by easy cash or over-ambition; it's about unlocking economies across multiple dimensions.

Well the classic and perfect example of this is on-demand routing across power networks, literally
