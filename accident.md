## My Portfolio

*Money gets boring, but markets are endlessly fascinating.*

<br/>


I fell into finance by accident.  After graduating from university in the late 1990s, I was (somewhat serendipitously) offered a job as a quant-analyst-programmer-odd-jobs-person at a hedge fund.  At the time hedge funds were not as famous (or notorious) as they are now, and I hardly knew the difference between a stock and a bond, but the idea of building mathematical models to predict the market sounded amazingly cool, so I took the plunge.

This was an extremely contrarian move at the time!  Most of my classmates 

But the idea 

I loved it.  I programmed other people's models, then created models of my own, then built systems to trade those models, then began trading them myself, and eventually I found myself a full-fledged portfolio manager.  I started out in fixed income arbitrage, then branched out into long-short relative value and global macro.  I was pretty darn good at it too.
