*This is not meant to be career advice, and frankly it's not likely to be very useful to anyone other than as a memoir; the world is vey different now than it was back then*

I fell into finance by accident.  Growing up, I wanted to be a scientist -- either astrophysics, or biotech -- Carl Sagan or Jurassic Park :)

This in itself was an unusual inclination for a middle-class kid in 1990s India.  Engineering, medicine, law, accountancy -- these were the usual, "safe" choices; and that was my family: my father was a doctor, my mother taught high-school English, I had 3 uncles who were engineers and 3 others who were lawyers.  

And I had that option!  I was accepted into India's top medical school, and also into India's top engineering school.  (I've always been good at competitive exams).  But I took the path somewhat less trodden; I joined IIT Bombay, but instead of mechanical or electrical or chemical engineering, I chose to major in physics.  Academia beckoned.

I was in for a rude awakening.  I quickly realized that there was a world of difference between liking physics, and doing physics as a career.  I realized that I didn't have the singleminded focus required to be an academic; also, I was too impatient. lacked the patience to do a 7-year PhD followed by postdocs and tenure track and everything else.  I still loved physics, but a physics career was not for me.

This left me at a loose end.  While my departmental classmates were winning full-ride scholarships to Stanford and Princeton and MIT and Yale and Cornell and Caltech, I entered my senior year compltely at a loss for what to do next.  I was accepted into IIMA but didn't really want to go ;  I wanted to leave school and experience the world.  At the same time, the types of jobs on offer -- management track, software development, -- didn't seem very appeaing.


And that's when I was presented with an intriguing 

A very small fnd -- 7 people at the time. 
Seed money from 

Mikami, Kawamura, Kuriyan, Kamel, Thomas, Tanudjaja and Cheung. 

They wanted a quant odd jobs person .


Now you have to remember that this was the mid 90s.  At the time, hedge funds were an extremely obscure corner of finance.  Quant investing was still in its infancy.  

And I certainly  

On the other hand -- oti sounded so cool!

My friends thought I was nuts.  To give up IIMA, to give up safe job offers at known-brand ompanies ,only to join a tiny little firm that nobody had heard of, in an industry that nobody knew anything about, in a country I'd never been -- 

But to me these were all bonuses.  New horizons!  It was an adventure.  What's the worst that could happen  I'd get to see Japan.  In the supreme confidence of youth, I was sure that if I hated it, or if they hated me, i would quit, come home, write the b-school admission tests again, and breeze through.  (I later realized how arrogant this was).

Tody of course hedge funds are very different.  Evyrbody knows about them; they're gamous, notorous.  Hit television shows are made abou them.  

Back then, it was very different.  It was tan incredibly obscure field.  More so in India -- a country jst emnerging from socialism -- we knew nothing of finance.

So in August of 1998, knowing no Japanese and knowing nothing about finance and barely knowing how to code, I hopped on a plane to Tokyo to take up a new job programming financial models for a Japanes hedge fund. 



I loved it.  I started out 

I programmed other people's models, then created models of my own, then built systems to trade those models, then began trading them myself, and eventually I found myself a full-fledged portfolio manager.  I started out in fixed income arbitrage, then branched out into long-short relative value and global macro.  I was pretty darn good at it too.

Growing up, my hero was Carl Sagan, and I wanted to be a scientist -- ideally, a physicist.  I studied Enginner



Taking the plunge served me really well.

Being open to serendipity. 

That was what gave me the courage to quit the hf industry cold turkey, a decade later.



Be lucky
Be open to luck

I fell into finance by accident.  After graduating from university in the late 1990s, I was (somewhat serendipitously) offered a job as a quant-analyst-programmer-odd-jobs-person at a hedge fund.  At the time hedge funds were not as famous (or notorious) as they are now, and I hardly knew the difference between a stock and a bond, but the idea of building mathematical models to predict the market sounded amazingly cool, so I took the plunge.

This was an extremely contrarian move at the time!  Most of my classmates 

But the idea
