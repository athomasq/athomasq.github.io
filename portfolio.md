## My Portfolio

*Money is boring, but markets are endlessly fascinating.*

<br/>

### My Investing Background

I fell into finance by accident.  After graduating from university, I was (somewhat serendipitously) offered a job as a programmer slash analyst slash odd jobs person at a hedge fund.  At the time hedge funds were not as famous (or notorious) as they are now, and I certainly didn't know a stock from a bond, but the idea of building mathematical models to predict the market sounded amazingly cool, so I took the plunge.

I loved it.  I programmed other people's models, then created models of my own, then built systems to trade those models, then began trading them myself, and eventually I found myself a full-fledged quant portfolio manager.  I started out doing fixed income arbitrage (bonds, swaps, futures, options etc), then branched out into long-short relative value and global macro.  I was pretty damn good at it too (if I say so myself).

My best trade was my last one.  In early 2007, around my 30th birthday, I wound down my portfolio near its all-time high water mark, and walked away.  Partly this was because the market as a whole felt unhealthy to me -- too much capital and leverage, not enough opportunity -- but mostly this was because I was getting bored.  I didn't want to spend the rest of my live moving money around, so I left.

I still invest, but only for myself.  I believe markets are incredibly efficient at a micro level, so I prefer not to invest in specific securities, only indexes.  At the same time, I believe markets are often inefficient at the macro level, so I'm not afraid to rotate aggressively.  I don't aim to beat the market or generate alpha; I aim to minimize my maximum regret. 

While I'm no longer a full-time trader, I continue to find markets endlessly fascinating.  The interplay of logic and reason and psychology and emotion; of mathematics and analysis and fear and greed; the feedback loops and non-linearity; the game theory and dynamic behaviour and emergent phenomena; the newness of every episode but also the deep rhymes with the past -- it's rich and rewarding and worthy of study for many lifetimes.

### My Current Portfolio

*(This section will be updated once a quarter -- at best.)*

At the end of 2019, I moved largely into cash and bonds. As of 2019-12-31, my overall allocation is:

- 57% medium-duration bonds 
- 20% cash
- 15% large-cap (public) equities via an index ETF
- 4% small-cap (startup) equities
- 4% residential real estate

I assign a higher probability than the market currently does to a U-shaped recovery and possible debt-deflation in the United States.

### My Startup Portfolio

I occasionally invest in startups, thought I don't consider myself an active angel investor.  Here are my investments as of 2019-12-31:

- [Locus](https://locus.sh/): logistics intelligence (Series B - Tiger Global, Falcon Edge)
- [Vue](https://vue.ai/): computer vision for commerce (Series A - Sequoia)
- [Doxper](http://doxper.com/): smart tools for physicians (Series A - Alkemi)
- [i2e1](https://i2e1.com/): internet for everyone, everywhere (Series A - Omidyar)  
- [Wellthy](https://wellthytherapeutics.com/): controlling diabetes (Series A - Cipla)  
- [AdSparx](https://www.adsparx.com/): online video infrastructure (profitable)  
- [Daloopa](https://www.daloopa.com/): smart financial models (early)  
- [Mero](https://mero.co/): smart building infrastructure (early)  
- FastFox: platform for rentals (acquired by Housing.com)  
- GoMoLo: IMDB for Bollywood (failed)  
- Qyk: marketplace for local services (failed)  
- TableHero: restaurant platform (failed)  

It's early days, but so far the outcomes seem to follow a classic power law distribution.  Out of 12 investments over 6 years, I have 1 at >20x, 1 at >5x, 3 at 2-5x, 4 at 1x, and 3 at 0x.  My IRR on angel investments is 35% (including the failures), though it's hard to tell how much of that is skill and how much is luck.

In addition to investing directly in startups, I am an LP in [GrowX Ventures](http://www.growxventures.com/), a firm I believe is India's best seed-stage venture investor.

### For Founders

If you're a startup founder looking for investment, I'd be happy to chat -- with the caveat that I say no to the vast majority of deals I see, and even when I do say yes, I invest fairly small amounts.

I prefer B2B to consumer.  I'm most familiar with business models that involve data, APIs and network effects, though I'm open to others.  I especially like startups solving tedious problems in unglamorous sectors.  If any of this sounds like you, please [email me](mailto:athos1@gmail.com)!

#### *Footnote* 

*I recognize the immense privilege embodied in the first sentence on this page.  I have the luxury of saying "money is boring" because I've never had to worry about food, or rent, or bills, or debt.  This makes me extraordinarily lucky compared to the vast majority of humanity, and I am grateful.*
