## My Startup Portfolio

----

<br/>


I occasionally invest in startups, thought I don't consider myself an active angel investor.  Here are my investments as of December 2019:

- [Locus](https://locus.sh/): logistics intelligence (Series B - Tiger Global, Falcon Edge)
- [Vue](https://vue.ai/): computer vision for commerce (Series A - Sequoia)
- [Doxper](http://doxper.com/): smart tools for physicians (Series - Alkemi)
- [i2e1](https://i2e1.com/): internet for everyone, everywhere (Series A - Omidyar)  
- [Wellthy](https://wellthytherapeutics.com/): controlling diabetes (Series A - Cipla)  
- [AdSparx](https://www.adsparx.com/): online video infrastructure (profitable)  
- [Daloopa](https://www.daloopa.com/): smart financial models (early)  
- [Mero](https://mero.co/): smart building infrastructure (early)  
- FastFox: platform for rentals (acquired by Housing.com)  
- GoMoLo: IMDB for Bollywood (failed)  
- Qyk: marketplace for local services (failed)  
- TableHero: restaurant platform (failed)  

It's early days, but so far the outcomes seem to follow a classic power law distribution.  Out of 12 investments over 6 years, I have 1 at >20x, 1 at 5x, 3 at 2-5x, 4 at 1x, and 3 at 0x.  (Markups on most recent rounds versus first investment).  I'm currently at a portfolio IRR of 35%, though it's hard to tell how much of that is skill versus luck.

In addition to investing directly in startups, I am an LP in [GrowX Ventures](http://www.growxventures.com/), a firm I believe is India's best seed-stage venture investor.

### For Founders

If you're a startup founder looking for investment, I'd be happy to chat -- with the caveat that I say no to the vast majority of deals I see, and even when I do say yes, I invest fairly small amounts.

I prefer B2B to consumer.  I'm most familiar with business models that involve data, APIs and network effects, though I'm open to others.  I especially like startups solving tedious problems in unglamorous sectors.  If any of this sounds like you, please [email me](mailto:athos1@gmail.com)!
