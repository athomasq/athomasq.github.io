## Data

----

As a species, we are defined by our ability to manipulate information: language, writing, software.  It's not a coincidence that the word we associate most strongly with human evolutionary advantage -- *intelligence* -- means both raw data, and the capacity to act on it.  

I'm fascinated by data and all the ways it can be used.  Here are some writings and resources on data:

* [APIs Are Eating the World](APIs-are-eating-the-world)  
* [A Data Framework for COVID-19](a-data-framework-for-covid-19)  
* [Data-Driven Versus Data-Informed](data-driven-data-informed)

<i><b>Data rules everything around me.</b> My professional career has revolved around data: specifically, how sophisticated organizations can use data to gain scalable and sustainable competitive advantages. I'm co-founder and Chief Data Officer at Quandl, a startup that built the first true marketplace for data and pioneered the category of "alternative data for finance".  As a result, I know quite a bit about data, data usage, data business models, and the data economy.</i>
