*Here's an example of a concise investor update email:*


### Summary

This is Buzz Corp's update for Feb 2022.  As a reminder, Buzz Corp builds software marketing tools for professional beekeepers.


### KPIs

**North star:** beehives serviced: 314,159 (+10%)  
**MRR:** $24,300 (+8%)  
**Gross burn:** $29,000 (+6%)  
**Cash in bank:** $82,000  
**Baseline runway:** 17 months (constant burn and MRR)  
**Projected runway:** 23 months (burn and MRR grow as forecast)  


### Specific Updates

**Good:** Revenue growing steadily thanks to referrals and SEO.  Runway keeps extending.

**Bad:** Haven't figured out outbound sales -- our experiment with BDRs didn't succeed. Churn is still on the high side.

### Asks

Need some advice on the best way to reduce churn. Intros to any customer success experts would be appreciated.
