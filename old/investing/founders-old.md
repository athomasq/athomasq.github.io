## For Founders

----

<br/>

If you're a startup founder looking for angel investment, please [email me](mailto:at@abrahamthomas.info)!

To set expectations: 
- I invest small amounts.
- I'm flexible on industry, business model, and geography.
- I'm not afraid of early companies, long horizons or deep tech.
- I like companies solving tedious problems in unglamorous sectors. 
- I'm most familiar with business models involving data, APIs, and network effects.  I also know capital markets and fintech well.
- I try to add value where I can, and stay out of the way if I can't.

Here's a list of my current [angel investments](/angel).  

Startups are hard.  If I can help you with advice from my own journey as a founder, I'd be happy to do so; please [email me](mailto:at@abrahamthomas.info)!
