## Angel Investing

<br/>

### Portfolio

Here are my startup investments as of December 2020:

**Asia:**
- [Locus](https://locus.sh/): logistics intelligence (Series B - Tiger Global, Falcon Edge)
- [Vue](https://vue.ai/): computer vision for retail (Series B - Sequoia, Falcon Edge)
- [Doxper](http://doxper.com/): smart tools for physicians (Series A - Alkemi)
- [i2e1](https://i2e1.com/): internet for everyone, everywhere (Series A - Omidyar)  
- [Wellthy](https://wellthytherapeutics.com/): digital therapeutics (Seed - Saama Capital)  
- [Claro](https://www.claroenergy.in/): solar-powered irrigation (profitable)
- [AdSparx](https://www.adsparx.com/): online video infrastructure (acquired by Discovery Channel)  
- FastFox: platform for rentals (acquired by PropTiger)  
- GoMoLo: IMDB for Bollywood (failed)  
- Qyk: marketplace for local services (failed)  


**Americas:**
- [Canopy](https://www.canopyanalytics.com/): ERP for property managers (early)  
- [Daloopa](https://www.daloopa.com/): AI-powered financial models (early)  
- [Mero](https://mero.co/): sensors for smart buildings (early)  
- [Terra.do](https://terra.do): climate school (early)  
- [Buy Properly](https://buyproperly.ca/): fractional real estate (early)  
- TableHero: restaurant platform (failed)  

**Other:**
- [Setyl](https://www.setyl.com/): inventory management (early)



It's early days, but so far the outcomes seem to follow a classic power law distribution.  Out of 17 investments over 6 years, I have 2 at >10x, 5 at 2-10x, 7 at 1x, and 3 at 0x.  My IRR on angel investments is over 30% (including the failures), though it's too early to tell how much of that is skill and how much is luck.

### GrowX

In addition to investing directly in startups, I am an LP in and advisor to [GrowX Ventures](http://www.growxventures.com/), who I believe to be India's best seed-stage venture capital firm.  Through GrowX, I'm an investor in:

- [ProgCap](https://progcap.com/): credit for small-biz inventory (Series A - Sequoia)
- [Pixxel](https://pixxel.space/): micro-satellites (Seed - Lightspeed)
- [Advantage Club](https://www.workadvantage.in/): employee rewards and benefits
- [Bellatrix](https://www.bellatrixaerospace.com/): next-gen rocket thrusters

### For Founders

If you're a startup founder looking for investment, I'd be happy to chat -- with the caveat that I say no to the vast majority of deals I see, and even when I do say yes, I invest fairly small amounts.

I prefer B2B to consumer.  I'm most familiar with business models that involve data, APIs and network effects, though I'm open to others.  I especially like startups solving tedious problems in unglamorous sectors.  If any of this sounds like you, please [email me](mailto:at@abrahamthomas.info)!
