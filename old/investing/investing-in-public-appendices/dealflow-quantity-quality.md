## Quantity Versus Quality Of Dealflow

----
*"Ninety percent of everything is junk."* -- Ted Sturgeon (Sturgeon's Law).

How many companies should I aim to meet?

My goal is to make 6-8 new investments a year.  How big does the top of my funnel need to be to support this?  Presumably an investor who sees 200 companies has better odds of finding 6 excellent ones than an investor who sees just 20.  But does one who sees 2000 do even better?  At what point do diminishing returns set in?  

Is there a point at which the marginal value of new leads turns negative?  Pitch fatigue, information overload, cognitive capture, trend immersion -- these are all real things.  Perhaps seeing too many deals actually degrades your judgement.  

More fundamentally, does quantity imply quality?  I think there's a correlation; quantity is necessary, but not sufficient.  List yourself as an angel investor on LinkedIn, Twitter and elsewhere, and you'll get plenty of cold emails from founders, accelerators, incubators, but are those the emails you want?  It's not clear.

On average, I've found that warm intros and in-network connections are likely to deliver higher quality companies to me.  That said, I don't care about averages, I care about outliers.  I'm also opposed to warm-intro policy for [systemic reasons](https://medium.com/@DelJohnsonVC/ban-warm-introductions-1e69169d57ba).  Finally, I suspect that "connected" startups trade at higher valuations, potentially negating any supposed edge in quality.  

Does the answer depend on my own reputation?  As a beginner angel investor with a relatively low profile, I know I see only a fraction of the deals I'd like to invest in, so I should probably try to increase the top of my funnel.  For a partner at Sequoia, though, it seems unlikely that raw TOFU count is the problem.

Where's the sweet spot?  If I had to guess, higher than 150 companies a year (my current level), but lower than 1000 (the number that many VCs quote).  Not unrelated, I find that too many VCs are jaded and overworked and hence default to meta-analysis aka following the herd.

Do good deals follow a Poisson process?  Certainly my own investing has been rather lumpy: 2 investments on the same day (!) in June, nothing for the next 4 months, then 4 in the next 4 weeks.  Should I expect a steady cadence, or is lumpiness part of the game?  Is there anything to be gained from trying to time-smooth my investing intra-year?  (Multi-year, it makes sense, because of valuation regimes: I want to invest all through the cycle, both ups and downs.)

Intuitively I feel like if I invest in say 1 out of every 50 companies I see, I should end up with a pretty good portfolio.  (I'm currently at about 1 in 15.)  But selection rate is a poor metric to optimize on, because you can improve it by increasing the denominator (see lots of terrible companies), whereas what you really want is to increase the numerator.

Fun questions to ponder!
