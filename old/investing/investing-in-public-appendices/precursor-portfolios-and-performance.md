5. I had a couple of precursor portfolios before my current foray into angel investing.  From 2009 to 2014 I invested in 5 friends-and-family ventures in India.  All but one have sunk without a trace; the one is going strong and on track for a large, indeed possibly a very large outcome, but not any time soon.  

From 2015 to to 2017 I invested in 8 arms-length ventures again in India; that portfolio has done quite well (it's currently at 3.4x DPI, 5.5x TVPI and 41% IRR).  Two companies are on unicorn trajectories.  I exited one of them at a 40x markup, and am holding on to the other.  A couple of the others may return 1-3x but are unlikely to return more than that.  Standard power law dynamics, in fact. 

The performance of these two portfolios has given me a little bit of encouragement that I'm on the right track; I wouldn't be increasing my annual investment count (or dollars) without that confirmation.
