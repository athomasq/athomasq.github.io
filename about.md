title: About Â· Abraham Thomas
---

Hello, I'm Abraham.  I live in Toronto with my family, several thousand books, and two pianos.  

I'm the co-founder and Chief Data Officer of Quandl, a technology startup that was acquired by Nasdaq in December 2018.

Before Quandl, I was an analyst, trader and portfolio manager at Simplex Asset Management, a large multi-strategy quant hedge fund headquartered in Tokyo.

Simplex hired me as a fresh graduate from IIT Bombay, where I studied Engineering Physics for my B. Tech.

## Creation + Curation

Magic happens at the intersection of competences.  

Creation: The amount of high-quality information on the internet is staggering.  But there are gaps, and this website attempts to fill a few of them.  I write mostly about data, markets and technology: areas where I have significant experience and expertise.

Curation: The amount of high-quality information on the internet is staggering.  So too is the amount of low-quality information.  There's value to informed curation, and this website attempts to provide some of that.
