## About me

Hello, I'm Abraham.  I live in Toronto with my partner, our offspring, several thousand books and two pianos.  

I'm the co-founder and Chief Data Officer of Quandl, a technology startup that was acquired by Nasdaq in December 2018.

Before Quandl, I was a programmer, analyst, trader and portfolio manager at Simplex Asset Management, a large multi-strategy quant hedge fund headquartered in Tokyo.

Simplex hired me as a fresh graduate from IIT Bombay, where I studied Engineering Physics for my B. Tech.

## About this website

"Creation plus curation."

Part 1: The amount of high-quality information on the internet is staggering.  But there are gaps, and this website is an attempt to fill a few of them.  I'm especially interested in data, markets and technology: areas where I have some experience and expertise.

Part 2: The amount of high-quality information on the internet is staggering.  So too is the amount of low-quality information.  There's value to informed curation, and this website will attempt to do that.
