## Greetings!

Hello, I'm Abraham.  I live in Toronto with my family, several thousand books, and two pianos.  

I'm the co-founder and Chief Data Officer of [Quandl](https://www.quandl.com), a technology startup that was acquired by [Nasdaq](http://www.nasdaq.com) in December 2018.  Before Quandl, I was a portfolio manager at [Simplex Asset Management](https://www.simplexasset.com), a large multi-strategy quant hedge fund headquartered in Tokyo.  Simplex hired me as a fresh graduate from [IIT Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in), where I studied Engineering Physics for my B. Tech.

Magic happens at the intersection of competences.  I have three: markets, technology and data.

## Markets

Straight out of university, I spent almost a decade (1998-2007) at Simplex Asset Management, a hedge fund spun out of the legendary [Salomon Brothers arbitrage desk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liar%27s_Poker).  I was a programmer, bond trader, and the youngest ever portfolio manager at Simplex; while there, I built one of the industry's first automated ("high-frequency") trading systems for bond arbitrage.  

I have expert-level knowledge of modern quantitative finance: hedge fund strategies, sources of edge, decision-making under uncertainty, leverage, risk, optionality and non-linearity, feedback, models and meta-models, market microstructure, global macro and econ, arbitrage and rel-val, organizational incentives and imperatives, information advantages, technology and much more.  I'm especially interested in how these modes of thought generalize beyond capital markets.

## Technology

After Simplex, I co-founded [Quandl](https://www.quandl.com), a venture-backed technology startup.  Quandl was created to address a problem I encountered time and again in my investing career: there's an amazing amount of information in the world, but much of it is hard to find and hard to use.  Quandl solves that.  

My co-founder and I started as two engineers building a prototype in a windowless basement; grew our team to 50 exceptional people; raised 20M in financing from blue-chip Silicon Valley venture capital firms; created the category of "alternative data" for investors; gained essentially all of the world's leading hedge funds as our customers; and were ultimately [acquired](https://blog.quandl.com/quandl-the-next-chapter) by Nasdaq (NDAQ) in Canada's [largest tech exit of 2018](https://blog.usejournal.com/canadian-tech-exit-leaderboard-f4ef1374a5ae).  

Thanks to this journey, I have deep knowledge of the modern tech ecosystem and startup execution: company formation, product creation & iteration, venture financing, full-stack marketing, sales strategy & execution, finance & legal, technology & infrastructure, the dynamics of SaaS and marketplace businesses, competitive strategy at many stages and along many dimensions, building and retaining high-performance teams,and exiting (exciting!).

## Data

At both Simplex and Quandl, my professional career has revolved around data.

I have expert-level knowledge of modern data businesses: data pipelines (acquire/evaluate, structure/transform, research/apply, deliver/deploy), data and API-first business models (subscription, marketplace, broking, co-ops, give-to-get, DaaS, platforms, infrastructure, glue), data usage in finance and other industries, data supply chains, data and information advantages (speed, accuracy, coverage, uniqueness, quality), data valuation and monetization, data methods (storage, compute, analytics, dataviz, AI/ML, human-in-the-loop), managing data science and data engineering teams, data-driven decision making, and the limitations of data.  That's a lot of words.

## Contact

If you're interested in any of the above topics or if you just want to chat, I welcome your [emails](mailto:athos1@gmail.com), though I can't always guarantee a prompt reply.  I'm also on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/athomasq) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/athomasq).

I occasionally invest small amounts in early-stage startups, especially when they intersect with the themes above.  If you're a startup founder looking for either advice or investment, [email me].

If you're a hedge fund looking for valuable data, or you have data that you want to find value in, [email me].

If you're a venture capitalist involved in data businesses -- you guessed it, [email me].
