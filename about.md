Magic happens at the intersection of competences.  I have three: markets, technology and data.

## Markets

Straight out of university, I spent a decade (1998-2007) at Simplex Asset Management, a hedge fund spun out of the legendary [Salomon Brothers arbitrage desk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liar%27s_Poker).  I was a programmer, quant analyst, bond trader, and the youngest ever portfolio manager at Simplex; while there, I built one of the industry's first automated ("high-frequency") trading systems for bond arbitrage.  

I have expert-level knowledge of modern quantitative finance: hedge fund strategies, sources of edge, decision-making under uncertainty, leverage, risk, optionality and non-linearity, feedback, models and meta-models, market microstructure, global macro and econ, arbitrage and relative value, organizational incentives and imperatives, information advantages, technology and much more.  I'm especially interested in how these modes of thought generalize beyond capital markets.

## Technology

After Simplex, I co-founded [Quandl](https://www.quandl.com) with my friend [Tammer Kamel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tammerkamel).  Quandl was created to address a problem I encountered time and again in my investing career: there's an amazing amount of information in the world, but much of it is hard to find and hard to use.  Quandl solves that.  

Tammer and I started as two engineers building a prototype in a windowless basement; grew our team to 50 people; raised 20M in financing from blue-chip Silicon Valley venture capital firms; created the category of "alternative data" for investors; gained essentially all of the world's leading hedge funds as our customers; and were ultimately [acquired](https://blog.quandl.com/quandl-the-next-chapter) by Nasdaq (NDAQ) in Canada's largest tech exit of 2018.  

Thanks to this journey, I have deep knowledge of the modern tech ecosystem and startup execution: company formation, product creation & iteration, venture financing, full-stack marketing, sales strategy & execution, finance & legal, technology & infrastructure, the dynamics of SaaS and marketplace businesses, competitive strategy at many stages and along many dimensions, building and retaining high-performance teams,and exiting (exciting!).

## Data

At both Simplex and Quandl, my professional career has revolved around data.

I have expert-level knowledge of modern data businesses: data pipelines (acquire/evaluate, structure/transform, research/apply, deliver/deploy), data and API-first business models (subscription, marketplace, broking, co-ops, give-to-get, DaaS, platforms, infrastructure, glue), data usage in finance and other industries, data supply chains, data and information advantages (speed, accuracy, coverage, uniqueness, quality), data valuation and monetization, data methods (storage, compute, analytics, dataviz, AI/ML, human-in-the-loop), managing data science and data engineering teams, data-driven decision making, and the limits of data.

## Balance

While I believe in the power of markets, technology and data to make the world a better place, I'm also keenly aware of their limitations. 

Data can be noisy, messy, incomplete or irrelevant; more dangerously, it can be misleading, invasive, biased or falsified.  Markets can be imperfect, incomplete, non-competitive, regulated, corrupt, captured, rigged or otherwise flawed.  Technology is vulnerable to incompetence, malice, misuse, indifference, bias and unforeseen consequences.  

The optimist (and trader) in me says that every inefficiency is an opportunity; the humanist in me cares for the individuals affected by these inequities.  It's important to strike a balance.

## Contact

If you're interested in any of the above topics or if you just want to chat, [email me]!   My approach to email is essentially the [same](https://www.kalzumeus.com/standing-invitation) as Patrick McKenzie's.

You can also reach me via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/athomasq) and [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/athomasq).

I occasionally invest small amounts in early-stage startups, especially when they intersect with the themes above.  If you're a startup founder looking for either advice or investment, [email me].

If you're a hedge fund looking for valuable data, or you have data that you want to find value in, [email me].

If you're a venture capitalist involved in data businesses -- you guessed it, [email me].
