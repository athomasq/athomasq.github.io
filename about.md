## About me

Hello, I'm Abraham.  I live in Toronto with my partner, our offspring, several thousand books and two pianos.  

I'm the founder and Chief Data Officer of Quandl, a technology startup that was acquired by Nasdaq in December 2018.  <!-- You can read more about Quandl here. -->

Before Quandl, I was a programmer, analyst, trader and portfolio manager at Simplex Asset Management, a large multi-strategy quant hedge fund headquartered in Tokyo.  <!-- Here are some thoughts on trading, risk, decisions and outcomes. -->

Simplex hired me straight out of IIT Bombay, where I studied Engineering Physics for my B. Tech.  <!-- While at IIT-B, I spent a lot of time on extra-curricular activities: trivia quizzing, debate, drama, writing and editing.  I also started a poetry mailing list and website that was quite popular. --> 


## About this website

"Creation plus curation."

Part 1: The amount of high-quality information on the internet is staggering.  But there are gaps, and I'd like to fill them.  I'm interested in a few different topics: data, markets, technology, startups, economics that I have reason to believe I have expertise in.

Part 2: The amount of high-quality information on the internet is staggering.  So too is the amount of low-quality information.  I think there's a lot of value to informed curation, and I'm going to use this website to do that.
