### Work

I work at the intersection of data, markets, and technology.  Here are a few things I've done:

🚀 Founded Quandl, a SaaS-enabled B2B marketplace for data. We pioneered the category of [alternative data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_data_(finance)) for finance, changing the industry along the way. Quandl was acquired by Nasdaq in 2018. 

📈 Early employee at Simplex Asset Management, a quant hedge fund. I built one of the bond market's first [algorithmic trading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_trading) systems, and headed US Treasury trading for Simplex before retiring in 2007.

🎓 Studied Engineering Physics at IIT Bombay, India's top technology school.  While there, I helped set up India's first campus data network, and won a bunch of awards, mostly for extra-curriculars and leadership.

### Investing

🦋 I'm an active angel investor in early-stage B2B startups.  I'm flexible on industry, commercial model and geography.  *View my portfolio.*

💽 I’m most familiar with businesses involving data, APIs, and network effects. I also know capital markets and fintech well.  

🔧 I can help on almost all operational aspects of early-stage startups.  I'm especially strong on story-telling, hybrid g2m, recruiting/culture, and of course all things data.  

📫 **Founders, if any of this sounds interesting, please reach out!**    

🌐 I'm also building out my network, and welcome inquiries from fellow angels looking for co-investors, doing diligence, or simply sharing ideas.
