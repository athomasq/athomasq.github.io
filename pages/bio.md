## My Story

----

*I went from being a wartime refugee as a child, to a student leader in university, to a portfolio manager at a large hedge fund, to co-founder of a successful tech startup.  This is my story.*

<br/>

**At 13**, I spent 3 days in the hold of a cargo ship, [escaping a war zone](/invasion) with nothing more than what I could carry in a backpack.  

**At 17**, I graduated from high school in south India as valedictorian and head boy; I was also on my school's basketball, soccer, debate, quiz and math teams. I was accepted into both [AIIMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_India_Institute_of_Medical_Sciences,_New_Delhi) and [IIT Bombay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Institute_of_Technology_Bombay), and chose to study [Engineering Physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Engineering_physics) at the latter.

**At 21**, I turned down graduate school to join a tiny firm that "used math to predict the market".  One of Asia's first hedge funds, [Simplex](https://www.simplexasset.com/en/) eventually grew to hundreds of people and billions of dollars. I joined as employee #7.

**By 26**, I was a portfolio manager at the fund.  I set up and ran the fund's US office; I also led development of our real-time arbitrage infrastructure, a precursor to modern [algorithmic trading](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithmic_trading) systems.

**At 30**, I quit my hedge fund job.  I exited all my positions near the high-water mark of the portfolio in 2007, and moved to Canada.  (I've been an immigrant three times!)

**At 33**, I started [Quandl](https://www.quandl.com/) with my friend and co-founder Tammer Kamel.  We set out to solve a well-known problem: there's an enormous amount of valuable data in the world, but it's hard to find and hard to use.

**I was 37** when we launched the Quandl data marketplace.  We pioneered the category of [alternative data for finance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_data_(finance)), and acquired many of the world's top hedge funds, asset managers, fintechs and investment banks as our customers.

**I was 41** when Tammer and I sold Quandl to [Nasdaq](https://www.nasdaq.com/), in one of Canada's largest tech startup acquisitions of 2018.  

**I'm 43 now**, and as always, excited for what the future holds!

**With gratitude:** Over my career, I've benefited from privilege, serendipity and kindness, from friends, family, mentors, partners and complete strangers.  I thank you all.  *We are none of us alone.*
