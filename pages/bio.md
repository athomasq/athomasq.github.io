## My Story

----

At 13, I spent 3 days in the hold of a cargo ship, escaping a war zone with nothing more than what I could carry in a backpack.  

At 17, I graduated from high school in south India as valedictorian and head boy; I was also on my school's basketball, soccer, debate, quiz and math teams. I was accepted into both AIIMS and IIT Bombay, and chose to study Engineering Physics at the latter.

In university, I threw myself into extracurricular activities. I was institute general secretary, on the core group for TechFest and Mood Indigo, and set up India's first campus internet.  I also won a bunch of awards.

At 21, I was accepted into IIM-A but chose instead to join a tiny firm that "used math to predict the market".  One of Asia's first hedge funds, it eventually grew to 100s of people and billions of dollars under management. I joined as employee #7.

At 25, I set up US ops .   I was a senior PM.  I also built , one of the ancestors of today's HFT systems.

At 29, I quit.  I unwound positions and returned capital to investors near the high-water mark of the portfolio in 2007.  (Good timing!)

At 33, after a few years as a stay at home dad, I started working on Quandl. 

At 37, we launched the data marketplace

At 41

Stay tuned for what happens next! 

(My life seems to tuned to a 4-year cadence)




*I went from being a wartime refugee as a child, to an overachiever in high school, to a borderline dropout in university, to a star trader at a hedge fund, to a stay-at-home dad, to founder of a successful technology startup.  This is my story.*

The formative experience of my early childhood was the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in 1990.  My family was caught up in the conflict; after spending 2 months in army-occupied territory, we escaped via caravan through the desert followed by 3 days in the hold of cargo ship, carrying nothing more than what would fit in a backpack.




At the age of 13, I spent 3 days in the hold of a cargo ship, escaping a war zone with nothing more than what I could carry in a backpack.  

At the age of 17, I was accepted into India's top engineering school as well as India's top medical school, via two intensely competitive entrance examinations that had minimal overlap in study material.  The same year, I was on the basketball, soccer, track, debate, quiz and math teams at my high school, where I was also head boy and class valedictorian.  My teachers thought I was cruising and should have done better; they were right.

My teachers thought I was cruising and should have done better; they were right. 

At the age of 21, I graduated from IIT Bombay with a degree in Engineering Physics.  

My professors thought I lacked focus; they were right.




After graduating, at the age of 21, I was accepted into India's top business school, again via a competitive entrance examination.  I chose not to go; instead, I joined a hedge fund in tokyo, at a time when such an option was 

At the age of 23, I became the youngest trader at the fund.  I rose up the ranks and became a senior portfolio manager and head of north american investments.  I also built one of the first "automated systematic" trading systems -- the predecessor of what people call HFT today.

I made my first million by 27.  I quit on my 30th birthday, shortly before the market peaked and then crashed in the global financial crisis.  

I moved to Canada for the sake of my wife's career.  (She's also exceptional: with a similarly stellar academic and extracurricular record, she received her PhD in econ from Princeton, then and now ranked #1 in the world, and on a tenure).  While she published award-winnign research papers, I was a stay at home dad.

I came to Canada with no job and no network and no plans.  I knew exactly one other person in Toronto; he eventually bcame my co-founder.  

At the age of 34 I founded Quandl. 

We built a startup from scratch: technology, design, sales, marketing, ops.  I moved the stat of the art in data driven investing.  

I invested and advised.

We raised money from two blue-chip silicon valley VCs, for both of whom we were the first Canadian deal.  We closed every top hedge fund in the world as our customers, including some of the most secretive and celebrated.  We created a new category -- "alternative data for finance" -- and dominated it.

(I was raised in a culture that deprecates self-promotion.  This page is my remedy.)

We sold the company we founded to Nasdaq in Canada's largest venture fundded exit of 2018.

I'm now rested, relaxed, and ready for my next challenge.

Over-achievers, even hyper-achievers, are common.  It's important to me that I did it my way.



I did things my way. 



I did all this while my partner dealt with a chronic and debilitating illness, 

I did with kindness and cmpasson.  I was not an asshole.  My style is non-confrontational, collaborative.


I work hard, but I strive to live an examined life.  For me, this means purpose, harmony, and compassion.

I sleep for 8-9 hours every night.  I read (paper books! not work-related!) for 1-2 hours every day.  I take 2 or 3 vacations of 2 to 3 weeks every year.  I enjoy going to restaurants and concerts and shows.  I play tennis, and work out with a personal trainer several times a week.  I listen to new music.  I've always been present for my child's activities and hobbies and interests.  I learn new things all the time.  

It's a point of honour for me to do more than 50% of the housework -- cooking, meal-planning, groceries, cleaning, school pickups, accounts and paperwork, home maintenance and more.  I do not want to be "successful" if that success requires the unpaid and invisible labour of others.  

I've dealt with racism, prejudice and lack of network access; that's part of the deal with being an immigrant.  I also dealt with a chronic and debilitating illness faced by a close family member,.  I want to make the worl 

Do it with good humour and grace and compassion.  Be kind. 


honorable business, win-win
no assholes

work, family, personal

Its important to me to be an equal partner at home, which means I do all the cooking, mealplanning and kitchen, home maintenance all the paperwork and accounting, and 50% of all school and activity pickups, grocery shopping and other errands.  My partner does laundry, garden and the remaining 50%.  This may seem like a weird flex but it's important; it also offers a useful comparison against successful men who rely on the inpaid labour of their wives for housework, childcare, and life so that they can focus solely on their work.
