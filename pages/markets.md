## Markets

----

Markets are the most effective and resilient mechanism we have found to solve a hard problem: how should society allocate resources in the face of incomplete information and uncertain outcomes?  

Here are some writings and resources on markets: 

* [Rentec's Returns](/rentecs-returns)
* [Alfred Winslow Jones](/alfred-winslow-jones)  
* [Silk Ties](/silk-ties)  
* [Software Eats Marxism](/software-eats-marxism)  
* [Bond Arbitrage](/bond-arbitrage)  
* [Two Extremes of Market Efficiency](/two-extremes-of-market-efficiency)  
* [A Tale of Two Marketplaces: ICE and eBay](/why-might-ice-bid-for-ebay)

<i><b>Placing trades, trading places.</b> Straight out of university, I spent a decade at Simplex Asset Management, a hedge fund spun out of the legendary Salomon Brothers [bond arbitrage desk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liar%27s_Poker).  I was a programmer, quant analyst, bond trader, and the youngest ever portfolio manager at Simplex; while there, I built one of the industry's first automated ("high-frequency") trading systems for bond arbitrage.  Thanks to this experience, I have expert-level knowledge of capital markets, quant finance and hedge fund strategies.</i>
