|<img style="width:200px" src="/assets/img/Abraham-Thomas.jpg">|👋 Hello, I'm Abraham.<br/><br/>I'm a technology entrepreneur and [private investor](/angel) living in Toronto.<br/><br/>I'm the co-founder and former Chief Data Officer of [Quandl](https://www.quandl.com), a tech startup that was acquired by [Nasdaq](https://www.nasdaq.com) in 2018. <br/><br/>Before Quandl, I was a trader and portfolio manager at [Simplex](https://www.simplexasset.com), a multi-billion-dollar hedge fund in Tokyo.|

### Work

I work at the intersection of data, markets, and technology. Here are a few things I've done:

🚀 Founded Quandl, a SaaS-enabled B2B marketplace for data. We pioneered the category of alternative data for finance, changing the industry along the way. Quandl was acquired by Nasdaq in 2018.  

📈 Early employee at Simplex Asset Management, a quant hedge fund. I built one of the bond market's first algorithmic trading systems, and headed US investing and operations for Simplex before retiring in 2007.

🎓 Studied Engineering Physics at IIT Bombay, India's top technology school. While there, I helped set up India's first campus data network, and won a bunch of awards, mostly for extra-curriculars and leadership.
