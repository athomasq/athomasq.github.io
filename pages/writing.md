**[So, You Want To Monetize Your Data](/so-you-want-to-monetize-your-data)**  
Data behaves quite differently from other commodities, products and services -- often in complex, non-intuituve, non-linear ways. 

**[Explaining Rentec's Returns](/rentecs-returns)**  
What lies behind Renaissance's incredible returns? It turns out you don't need to invoke magic, genius or skulduggery; what you see is exactly what you'd expect, given a few simple assumptions.

**[Alfred Winslow Jones: the Hidden Architect of Modern Markets](/alfred-winslow-jones)**  
Let me tell you all about Alfred Winslow Jones. You may not have heard of him, but he’s one of the most important financiers of the 20th century.

**[Invasion!](/invasion)**  
When I was 13 years old, I spent 3 days in the hold of a converted cargo ship, escaping a war zone with nothing more than what I could carry in a backpack. It was the best thing that ever happened to me.

**[The Accidental Investor](/the-accidental-investor)**  
I fell into finance by accident. Here's how it happened. 

**[Silk Ties and Suckers: A Trading Story](/silk-ties)**  
What does your counterparty know that you don't?

**[Aliens Among Us](/aliens)**  
We search the skies for extraterrestrials, and we worry that software might achieve sentience.  But alien intelligences already live among us; we just don't recognize them.

**[Ambition Should Be Made of Sterner Stuff](/sterner-stuff)**  
In a memorable rallying cry, Marc Andreessen says "it's time to build".  But why haven't we been building?  What went wrong?

**[High Frequency Macroeconomics](/covid-19-and-high-frequency-macro)**  
Empirical macroeconomics has been transformed by the newfound availability of granular, timely, accurate and above-all *fast* data from non-traditional sources.

**[Tracking the COVID-19 Economy in Real Time](/covid-19-and-the-economy)**  
A collection of real-time charts on the impact of COVID-19 on the economy, using unusual (but fast!) sources of data.  (Now somewhat dated).

**[Pricing Curves for Data](/data-pricing-curves)**  
Data behaves quite differently from other commodities, products and services -- often in complex, non-intuituve, non-linear ways. 

**[The Goldilocks Theory of Trading Regimes](/two-extremes-of-market-efficiency)**  
It's hard to make money in markets that are perfectly efficient or perfectly inefficient.  What investors crave is a market that is moderate, predictable, and time-bound in its inefficiency.

**[Data-Driven versus Data-Informed: Two Philosophies of Investing](/data-driven-data-informed)**  
Do you let data tell you what to do in toto?  Or is data merely one input into a non-generalizable process that ultimately relies on human judgement?  This, increasingly, seems to be the key divide in active asset management. 

**[A Fine Line Between Stupid and Clever](/a-fine-line-between-stupid-and-clever)**  
Everybody wants to be contrarian these days; they think it makes them look smart. But the thing about being truly contrarian is that it doesn’t make you look smart. It makes you look dumb.

**[APIs Are Eating the World](/APIs-are-eating-the-world)**  
Software is eating the world -- and APIs are how software talks to other software. That's why so many of the hottest new tech companies, from Stripe to Shopify, are essentially just APIs.

**[How To Be An Excellent Failure](/failure-modes)**  
"Best practices" can be a trap. Functional excellence often breeds tunnel vision, and that way lies disaster.

<!--10 Jul 2015-->
**[Software Eats Marxism](/software-eats-marxism)**  
Click-baity title, but the thesis holds: software has the ability to make central planning a feasible reality. (We call it aggregator theory nowadays).

<!--13 Dec 2014-->
**[Three Decades of Bond Arbitrage](/bond-arbitrage)**  
A brief history of progress in a niche but lucrative field: from paper and calculators to real-time algorithms and high-frequency execution.  I had a ringside seat.

**[Disney, Amazon, and COVID as a Quant Factor](/amazon-disney-covid)**  
Companies, sectors and regions are disparately impacted by COVID, suggesting the emergence of what quants call a new "factor" in market dynamics, akin to value, growth and momentum.


**[Viral Dominos and Data Visions](/a-data-framework-for-covid-19)**  
How do you fit a flood of (often contradictory) information into a coherent view of the world? A framework for thinking about COVID-19.

**[A Tale of Two Marketplaces: ICE and eBay](/why-might-ice-bid-for-ebay)**  
Markets are agog with an unlikely merger rumour: ICE and eBay.  Why might this make sense?  I have thoughts.
