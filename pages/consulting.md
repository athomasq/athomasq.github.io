## Consulting

----

<br/>


I am available to consult of data businesses and data driven investing.  If you are interested in retaining my services, please [email me](mailto:athos1@gmail.com).

<br/>

## My Services

I typically work with institutional investors in the area of data-driven investing, and with mature (public or late-stage private) companies in the area of data strategy.  Here are some example client profiles:

- Quant, quantamental and fundamental hedge funds, looking to either stand up or scale up their data-related activities.

- PE, VC, sovereign wealth funds, endowments, and other non-data-centric investors looking to incorporate more or better data into their processes.

- Producers of "alternative data", on every aspect of their data productization and monetization, from compliance to infrastructure to gtm to ops.

- Consumers of "alternative data", on every aspect of their data acquisition, application and deployment, again from compliance to infrastructure to use cases to commercials to ops.

- Series C and later tech startups who have built nascent data businesses and seek guidance on scalabilty, competitive strategy, and data loops.

I consider myself an expert on data and API business models and the modern data ecosystem; on designing, building and scaling effective data organizations; and on modern quantitative and quantamental investing especially when it comes to capturing alpha from 'alternative' data.

## My Rates

I charge USD 1500 for an hour, USD 5000 for half a day, USD 8000 for a full day, or USD 25000 for a week (onsite if schedules permit).
