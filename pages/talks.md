### Inquiries


If you'd like me to speak at your event, please [email me](mailto:athos1@gmail.com).  Topics I often speak about include: 

- Modern financial markets and quantitative investing
- Data, especially unusual sources and applications of data
- Building data-driven organizations
- Launching, scaling and exiting a tech startup

Here are some useful assets: my [biography](/assets/docs/Abraham-Thomas-bio.txt) and my [profile picture](/assets/img/Abraham-Thomas.jpg).

Although I have sometimes done so in the past, please note that in future I will not speak at or attend events without an equitable number of women and minority speakers.
