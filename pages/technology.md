## Technology

----

Writing, agriculture, government, cities, money, industry: these and other technologies have all impacted humanity in profound (and still evolving) ways.  We're living through another technological revolution right now: **software**.  And we've barely scratched the surface of what it can achieve.

Here are some writings and resources on software and startups: 

* [Sterner Stuff](/sterner-stuff)  
* [When Excellence Fails](/when-excellence-fails)  
* [Aliens](/aliens)  
* [Looking Back, Looking Forward](/looking-back-looking-forward) 
* [Web Resources for Startup Founders](/web-resources-for-founders)

<i><b>Indistinguishable from magic.</b> I've spent the last decade as co-founder of Quandl, a data technology startup.  We began as two engineers building a prototype in a basement; grew our team to over 50 people; raised $20M in financing from blue-chip Silicon Valley venture capital firms; gained most of the world's leading hedge funds and investment banks as our customers; and were ultimately [acquired](https://blog.quandl.com/quandl-the-next-chapter) by Nasdaq (NDAQ).  Thanks to this journey, I have strong knowledge of startup execution and the contemporary tech ecosystem.</i>
