Hello, I'm Abraham.

I'm an angel investor.  (Pitch me!)

I write essays on data, investing, startups and more.

I'm a former (successful, exited) founder.

I was a portfolio manager at a quant hedge fund.

I occasionally speak at events, and appear in the press.

I have lots of hobbies and am always curious.
