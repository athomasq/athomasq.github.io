title: Abraham at First Round
---
## Hello, First Round Capital! 

----

It's nice to meet you.  

**Why are you interested in this role at First Round?**

A role at First Round would be my third career.  My first career was in finance -- I was a senior portfolio manager at Simplex, a large hedge fund.  My second career was in technology -- I am the co-founder of Quandl, a startup acquired by Nasdaq in one of Canada's largest tech exits of 2018.

I've used financial leverage and technological leverage, and I believe that "people leverage" is more potent than either.  Finding remarkable people and empowering them to change the world is the most fulfilling feeling I know, and the most impactful thing I can think of doing in the next stage of my life.  And First Round has built the world's best platform for doing this at scale.

Early stage is also where I thrive.  I love rolling my sleeves up and getting to work when things are still messy and unclear; when the possibilities are limitless but the constraints are very real; when there's a chance to create the foundation of something fantastic.  Both as a founder myself, and as an angel investor in and mentor to multiple startups here in Toronto, this is what motivates and energizes and excites me.  


**What is your superpower?**

I tweeted this a year ago: [Discipline married with optimism is a superpower](https://twitter.com/athomasq/status/1133117390584209408).

More specifically, it's *my* superpower.  I am the most optimistic person I know -- I'm constantly asking "why not?" and "what if? and "what could go right?".  I think this is important, and powerful.  **Startups are self-fulfilling prophecies.**  Being able to imagine and believe in and then actually create new realities is key to being a successful founder (or investor).

But optimism is meaningless without discipline: the ability to stay clear-eyed and do the work.  Learn everything there is to learn; pay rigorous attention to details; avoid self-delusion; dig deep and reach independent conclusions; be flexible yet decisive; stay focused and committed; execute.  Markets are efficient, and startups are hard.  You can't succeed in either arena without disciplined effort.

(I could add that I'm smart, competitive, curious, kind, high-integrity, a proven good investor, a quick learner and a strong communicator.  But those are all table stakes.  Disciplined optimism is what sets me apart.)


**Why would entrepreneurs pick you as a preferred Partner?**

Empathy and experience.

Being a founder is a lonely journey.  Startups have so many challenges -- product, technology, team-building, commercial success, competition, the list goes on.  I think founders gravitate to investors who are not just a source of dollars, but who have been through the same struggle, who are unquestionably on their side, who can understand and appreciate the challenges they face.

And then help solve them!  As an investor I can offer concrete advice based on recent and relevant experience.  Whether it's functional advice on product or sales or recruiting or pricing or go-to-market or fund-raising or culture-building; or whether it's more specialist advice on data or APIs or marketplaces or fintech or enterprise -- every startup is different, but some patterns are universal.


**Is there anything unique about your background or upbringing that we may not know about that might contribute to you being an excellent Partner?**

When I was 13 years old, I spent 3 days in the hold of a converted cargo ship, escaping a war zone with nothing more than what I could carry in a backpack.  

My family were caught up in Saddam Hussein's invasion of Kuwait in 1990; after witnessing pitched battles and living under military occupation, we escaped by desert caravan, through a refugee camp, then on to a cargo ferry before being airlifted to India.

We lost almost all our physical possessions, but gained much else.  The experience gave me a perspective I retain to this day: on resilience, on values and integrity, on the importance of optimism and kindness, on adaptability in fast-moving situations, on risk-taking and imperfect information, and much more.  

This perspective has been key to who I am and my career to date, and I know it will contribute to the First Round team.  


**Add a cover letter or anything else you want to share.**

Investing is a team sport.  I believe I have several attributes that will strengthen the First Round team:

- my perspective as a first-generation immigrant, visible minority and first-time founder outside the SF Bay Area.

- my presence and network in Toronto, the fastest-growing city in North America and a magnet for talented individuals from around the world.

- my approach as an investor who has been "on both sides of the table" in both public and private markets: as a hedge fund portfolio manager, startup founder and active angel.

- my knowledge of data- and API-centric business models, and more generally of the modern data economy.

- my many different flavors of experience -- as a wartime refugee, as a graduate from an elite engineering school, and as leader of a startup that went through many ups and downs before its final successful exit.

While any one of these might be shared with others, I do think the combination is unique, and powerful, and valuable.
