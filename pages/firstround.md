**Why are you interested in this role at First Round?**

In one word, impact.

A role at First Round would be my third career.  My first career was in finance -- I was a senior portfolio mananger at Simplex, a large hedge fund.  My second career was in technology -- I am the co-founder of Quandl, a startup acquired by Nasdaq in one of Canada's largest tech exits of 2018.

I've used financial leverage and technological leverage, and I believe that "people leverage" is more powerful than either.

Finding underappreciated, talented people, empowering them and helping them as much as possible, and then letting them loose on the world, is the most impactful thing I can think of doing in the next stage of my life, and First Round is perhaps the world's best platform for doing that. 

Seed is also  the right stage for me. I don't want to be a spreadsheet-driven financier of late stage companies; I want to roll my sleeves up and get to work when things are still messy and unclear; when the possibilities are limitless but the constraints are very real; when there's a chance to create the foundation of something fantastic.  I invest in and mentor a handful of startup founders here in Toronto and I love it. 


**What is your superpower?**

I tweeted this a year ago: [Discipline married with optimism is a superpower](https://twitter.com/athomasq/status/1133117390584209408).

More specifically, it's *my* superpower.  I am the most optimistic person I know -- I'm constantly asking "why not?" and "what if? and "what could go right?".  I think this is important, and powerful.  **Startups are self-fulfilling prophecies.**  Being able to imagine and believe in and then actually create new realities is key to being a successful founder (or investor).

But optimism is meaningless without discipline: the ability to stay clear-eyed and do the work.  Pay rigorous attention to facts; avoid self-delusion; learn everything there is to learn; be flexible yet decisive; stay focused and committed.  Markets are efficient; startups are hard.  You can't succeed in either arena without disciplined effort.

(I could add that I'm smart, competitive, curious, kind, high-integrity, a proven good investor, a quick learner and a strong communicator.  But those are all table stakes.  Disciplined optimism is what sets me apart.)

**Why would entrepreneurs pick you as a preferred Partner?**

Empathy and experience.

Being a founder is a lonely journey.  Startups have so many challenges -- product, technology, team-building, commercial success, competition, the list goes on.  I think founders gravitate to investors who are not just a source of dollars, but who have been through the same struggle, who are unquestionably on their side, who can understand and appreciate the challenges they face.

And then help solve them!  As an investor I can offer concrete advice based on recent and relevant experience.  Whether it's functional advice on sales or recruiting or pricing or go-to-market or fund-raising or culture-building; or whether it's more specialist advice on data or APIs or enterprise -- every startup is different, but some patterns are universal.

**Is there anything unique about your background or upbringing that we may not know about that might contribute to you being an excellent Partner?**
