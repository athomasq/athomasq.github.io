**It's nice to meet you.**


**A little about me**



**Why you should hire me**


**My writing**

**Why are you interested in this role at First Round?**

"Give me a place to stand and I will move the world".  I've spent my career in search of leverage.

Phase 1 was financial leverage.  I spent a decade at a 

Stage 2 was technological leverage.  I founded a 

Through my time, I've come to believe that "people leverage" is far more powerful then either of the other two.  

Finding underappreciated talented people, empowering them and helping them as much as you can, and then letting them loose on the world, is far more impactful than any amount of dollar leverage or technical infrastructure.

That's what I want to in stage 3 of my life, and First Round is, to me, perhaps the world's best platform for doing that. 

It's also the right stage.  I don't want to be a spreadsheet-driveb financier of late stage companies; I want roll my sleeves up and get to work when things are still messy and unclear.  When the possibilities are limitless but hte constraints are very real.  When you have a chance to create teh foundation of something fantastic.  That's the kind of environment I thirve in.


The only sustainable arbitrage is talent arbitrage.

And I believe I have something to give.

**What is your superpower?**

I tweeted this a year ago: Discipline married with optimism is a superpower.

More specifically, it's *my* superpower.  I am the most optimistic person I know -- I'm constantly asking "why not?" and "what if? and "what could go right?".  I think this is important.  Willing a startup into reality is an exercise in self-fulfilling propehcy, and optimism is a powerful tool.

But it's meaningless without discipline: the ability to do the work.  As a hedge fund portfolio manager, I had a reputation for being the most informed person in the space -- I would read 300-500 pages of reseach every weekend, to learn as much as I could about  

As a foudner, I've self-taught on everything from marketing to sales to tech to data to elgal to finance.  I'd make my own decisions, but had an encyclopedic knowledge of best practices.  this was necessary -- first time founder in the midwest)

The poitn is: Financial markets are efficient.  Startups fail.  It's ahrd enough to succeed in both those areas.  Don't lower your odds by not doing the work.  

Table stakes.

**Why would entrepreneurs pick you as a preferred Partner?**

empathy + experience
unwavering support


**Is there anything unique about your background or upbringing that we may not know about that might contribute to you being an excellent Partner?**


I think I bring several attributes to the partnership that you currently lack:

-- experience as an immigrant, visible minority, first-time founder from outside the tech ecosystem 

-- I was a wartime refugee as a child but also graduated from an elite school, and the combined perspective is I think atypical

-- exposure to Toronto, the fastest growing technology hub (and city) in North America 

-- years of experience in both public and private markets

-- excellence in 

Any one of these is perhaps not unique, but I believe the combination is. 


-- perspective.  both sides, public + private
-- geography -- toronto
-- experience -- immigrant, minority
-- skill -- data, api, finance & fintech, analytics, saas



i have something to give. max leverage.  
diversifcation: perspective, origin, geography



Absorbing information and reaching contrarian conclusions. 
also, this is cheating as its a second superpower, but i'm the most optimistic person I konw. 
writing?

At 13 i spent. 
lesson on values, ,good decisions, priorities, integrity

alignment.


But once you get that train on the tracks, if you’re someone who loves to learn, is endlessly curious, gets energized by working with & supporting founders, is inclined as an investor, loves to sell, & is competitive: I can’t imagine a better job.
