|<img style="width:200px" src="/assets/img/Abraham-Thomas.jpg">|Hello, I'm Abraham.  I live in Toronto with my family, several thousand books, and two pianos.<br/><br/>I'm the co-founder and Chief Data Officer of [Quandl](https://www.quandl.com), a technology startup that was acquired by [Nasdaq](http://www.nasdaq.com) in December 2018.  Before Quandl, I was a trader and portfolio manager at [Simplex](https://www.simplexasset.com), a multi-billion-dollar  hedge fund headquartered in Tokyo.  Simplex hired me as a fresh graduate from [IIT Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in), where I studied Engineering Physics for my B. Tech.|

This is my personal website, where I write about markets, technology and data.  Use the menu on the right to navigate: [about](/about) is as good a place to start as any.
