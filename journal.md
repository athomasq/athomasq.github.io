Things I've changed my mind about -- an ongoing series.


I used to think "follow your dream" and "do what you love" was decadent first-world fluff.

Growing up in India, nobody ever told us to follow our dreams and su

We were too aware of the wolf at the door.  

Following your dream was self-indulgent and juvenile.  While you'r following your dream, a billion others are working hard on

But it's subtler than that.

Posit: to be an outlier in any field, you have to work extremely hard.  Convincing young 'uns to do this is valuable.

In India, the wolf at the door does this.

In the USA, what's the incentive to work hard?  It's to do something you love.  (It's better than being motivated by mere success).

Choosing to do what you love is in fact the best filter to ensure you work really hard.

I used to think there was a tradeoff between quality and quantity, especially when it came to creative output.  I further believed that quality mattered more.

I now think I was wrong, for multiple reasons.

Quantity begets quality.  Potter.  Asimov, Mozart, .  Many of hte greatest artists were enormously prolific.

Elitism

Get our of the room, feedbak.  Practice, reps, 10k hours.

Modenr context: cost of reproduction, dstribution is zero.  No need for quality gatekeepers.  What matters is distrbytin.  The best tway to get distribution is quantity.

(social networks reward that.)

Reduced frictio
Yes the market rewards quantity

The most widely followed people on Twitter (and similar sites) are not necessariyl the most insightful, or the wittiest, or the most origianl, orthe most provcative, or the most thougtul.. They're the most prolific.

Sure, they tend to be above average when it comes to  insight or wit or originality or sass.  But they are *way* above average in terms of volume.

Every content marketer knows this.  Consistency is the secret of success.  Sustained, consistent, high volume, above average content.  Not the occasional amsterpiece.

Incentives of social networks.  

Professionals make this mistake a lot -- they think polish.  Also 2-factor experise.

Denigrate -- quantity is easy.  but it's not.   it's hard.

But there's a deeper mistake being made.  Its that quality and quantiy are oppoed, that there's a tradeoff. 





I've long felt that a necessary (if not quite sufficient) condition for the blow-off top that often marks the end of a bull market is the entry of retail investors.  I saw this first-hand in 1999 (dot-com day traders) and in 2007 (house flippers and )



Something I believe that seemingly not many other people do: there's plenty of alpha available in the market.  It just requires effort: time, resources, patience and schlep.  The low-hanging fruit may be gone, but there's plenty of juice at higher elevations.



Two things I simultaneously hold to be true:
A. The pace of social and technological change is faster than ever
B. The scope of social and technological ambition is narrower than ever

 (Follow him!).  Observation B is Peter Thiel's stagnation thesis.  Their mutual push and pull helps explain a lot of the world today.



 There truly is such a thing as the simplicity on the other side of complexity, the simplicity that comes from wisdom, experience and judgement.  Unfortunately it's almost impossible to distinguish from the simplicity of vacuous platitudes...



 Most data analysis is not statistically robust; it's just confirmation bias dressed up in fancy clothes.



first job matters!  japan.  growth vs fixed mindset.


ambition <> commitment, conviction





Things I believe that not many people do, part n+1:

Excessive optimization is bad.  Not just "premature optimization" in the classic Knuthian sense.  But 

- sustainability
- unexpected
- creativity
- nonlinear upside

Career wise, Google is what happens when you optimize.
