Magic happens at the intersection of competences.  I have three: markets, technology and data.

## Markets

Straight out of university, I spent a decade at Simplex Asset Management, a hedge fund spun out of the legendary [Salomon Brothers arbitrage desk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liar%27s_Poker).  I was a programmer, quant analyst, bond trader, and the youngest ever portfolio manager at Simplex; while there, I built one of the industry's first automated ("high-frequency") trading systems for bond arbitrage.  Thanks to this experience, I have expert-level knowledge of capital markets, quantitative finance and hedge fund strategies.

## Technology

After Simplex, I co-founded [Quandl](https://www.quandl.com) with my friend [Tammer Kamel](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tammerkamel).  Quandl was created to address a problem I encountered time and again in my investing career: there's an amazing amount of information in the world, but much of it is hard to find and hard to use.  Quandl solves that.  

Tammer and I started as two engineers building a prototype in a basement; grew our team to 50 people; raised 20M in financing from blue-chip Silicon Valley venture capital firms; created the category of "alternative data" for investors; gained essentially all of the world's leading hedge funds as our customers; and were ultimately [acquired](https://blog.quandl.com/quandl-the-next-chapter) by Nasdaq (NDAQ) in Canada's largest tech  exit of 2018.  Thanks to this journey, I have strong knowledge of startup execution and the contemporary tech ecosystem.

## Data

At both Simplex and Quandl, my professional career has revolved around data: specifically, how sophisticated organizations can use data to gain scalable and sustainable competitive advantages.  As a result I have broad and deep knowledge of the modern data economy.

## Balance

While I believe in the power of markets, technology and data to make the world a better place, I'm also keenly aware of their limitations.  Data can be biased; markets can be imperfect; technology can be flawed.

The optimist in me says that every inefficiency is an opportunity; the humanist in me cares for the individuals affected by these inequities.  It's important to strike a balance.

## Contact

If you're interested in these topics, please follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/athomasq).  

You can also [email me].  I enjoy getting email, and I try to read everything I receive, though I can't always promise a response.  My philosophy here is essentially the [same](https://www.kalzumeus.com/standing-invitation) as Patrick McKenzie's.

If you're a hedge fund looking for data, if you have data that you want to find value in, or if you're a venture capitalist interested in data businesses, [email me].

I very occasionally invest small amounts in early-stage startups, especially when they intersect with the themes above.  If you're a startup founder looking for either advice or investment, [email me].
