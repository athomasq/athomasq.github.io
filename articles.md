<br/>

Here are some articles I thought worth saving and returning to:

* [A Mathematician's Apology](/assets/docs/hardy.pdf) -- G. H. Hardy
* [Judgement Under Uncertainty](/assets/docs/kahneman-tversky.pdf) -- Tversky & Kahneman
* [Information Theory for Intelligent People](/assets/docs/dedeo.pdf) -- Simon DeDeo 
* [The Use of Knowledge in Society](/assets/docs/hayek.pdf) -- F. A. Hayek
* [A Person Paper on Purity in Language](/assets/docs/hofstadter.pdf) -- Douglas Hofstadter
* [Quantum Computing for the Very Curious](https://quantum.country) -- Matuschak & Nielsen 
* [You and Your Research](/assets/docs/hamming.pdf) -- Richard Hamming

Here are my (and to be honest, everybody's) favourite investor letters:

* [Warren Buffett](https://www.berkshirehathaway.com/letters/letters.html)
* [Jeff Bezos](https://ir.aboutamazon.com/annual-reports-proxies-and-shareholder-letters/default.aspx)
* [Mark Leonard](https://www.csisoftware.com/category/pres-letters)
* [Prem Watsa](https://www.fairfax.ca/financials/letter-to-shareholders/default.aspx)
* [Seth Klarman](/assets/docs/Seth-Klarman-Letters.pdf) (dated)
* [Howard Marks](https://www.oaktreecapital.com/insights/howard-marks-memos)

It's not so much the specific investment or corporate strategy; it's the window these letters offer into the thinking of people who are excellent at what they do.

Finally, there's an enormous amount of insight and wisdom contained in the *internal* documents of large organizations, but most of them are confidential.  Sriram Krishnan has a great collection of [memos](https://sriramk.com/memos) that are in the public domain.
