## The Well-Equipped Kitchen

----

<br/>  

I enjoy cooking; I cook a lot; and I think I'm a good cook.  I've spent a lot of time over the years building up a well-equipped kitchen; here are the items I use the most:

### Cookware

### Cuisines

My repertoire is fairly eclectic: most of the time I cook Indian (Kerala, Bengal, non-denominational desi), vaguely Asian (Hakka Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Thai) or when lazy, generic North American (grills, roasts, pastas, pizzas, tex-mex).  These days I'm exploring Middle Eastern and Mediterranean cuisine (Turkish, Israeli, Persian, Moroccan).

### 

The above list is based on a lot of background reading -- I tend to do a lot of research before buying anything.  I generally follow a barbell strategy when buying stuff: either buy brands that offer everyday quality at low prices (IKEA, CostCo, PC etc) or buy the top of the line (Le Creuset, Ankarsrum etc).  Avoid the messy middle.
