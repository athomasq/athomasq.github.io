## Resources for Startup Founders

I was a first-time founder; so was my partner Tammer.  While we're both engineers, neither of us had ever worked in technology firms, or startups, or in the Valley.  We built Quandl largely to scratch our own itch; through hard work and good luck we succeeded.

What strikes me looking back is how little we knew about building technology startups, and how much we learned along the way.  In this, we were aided immeasurably by the enormous amount of high-quality startup advice available -- for free! -- on the internet.  Back in the early 2010s, VCs were just discovering the power of content marketing to attract talented founders (VC is a dealflow business!), and they competed with each other to share their secrets with the world.  

Unfortunately, all good things come to an end.  The very success of this content marketing strategy attracted more content creators, and the average quality of startup advice online declined rapidly over the second half of the decade.  Much of what's out there today is either unusable, or redundant, or just plain wrong. 

----

When quantity increases and quality is variable, curation becomes valuable.  So I thought I'd post links to some of the resources that I found most useful in my own journey.  I've organized them by theme:

- [Oracles](/resources#oracles): the voices that define this era of tech entrepreneurship
- [Ideas](/resources#ideas): find something worth doing
- [Growth](/resources#growth): get noticed by the world
- [Metrics](/resources#metrics): measure what matters; make your measurements matter
- (More sections to be added over time)

There is a lot of material here, and for that I make no excuses.  If you're serious about building a startup, you have to put in the work.  I know of no successful founders who are not also learning machines.  And if you can benefit from other people's wisdom (instead of learning yourself by trial and error or deducing everything from first principles), why wouldn't you? 

Note that most of these are relevant for early stage founders, ie, from zero till about Series B -- after that, founders typically have access to far better and more focused sources of expertise than articles on the internet, no matter how insightful.  

Note also that much of this material is a few years old.  The best current wisdom is to be found on Twitter and Substack; it hasn't yet been collected into books or blog posts.  

A final vital piece of advice: *think for yourself*.  You can't build a startup the way you build a piece of IKEA furniture, by following instructions.  Reading all these articles is just table stakes; the necessary context and framework and background required for you to make smart, contrarian, correct decisions.  But only you can make those decisions.

I welcome recommendations for new articles to add to this list -- please [email me](mailto:athos1@gmail.com) your suggestions!

## Oracles

Let's start with the classics.  You can't be part of the tech ecosystem without knowing these books, internalizing their language, and understanding the (collective, not always perfectly overlapping) worldview they espouse:

- Marc Andreessen's [blog](https://a16z.com/2015/01/09/pmarca-blog-ebook)
- Paul Graham's [essays](http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html)
- [Zero to One](https://www.amazon.com/Zero-One-Notes-Startups-Future/dp/B00M284NY2) by Peter Thiel, also [online](https://blakemasters.com/peter-thiels-cs183-startup)
- [The Hard Thing About Hard Things](https://www.amazon.com/Hard-Thing-About-Things-Building-ebook/dp/B00DQ845EA) by Ben Horowitz, also [online](https://a16z.com/2016/09/04/ben-blog-ebook/)
- [Blitzscaling](https://www.blitzscaling.com/) by Reid Hoffman, also [online](https://medium.com/cs183c-blitzscaling-class-collection)

These 5 writers are essential to understanding the modern era of tech (2009 to 2019: Uber's founding to WeWork's non-IPO).  You can find all of them in this [excellent series of videos](http://startupclass.samaltman.com/lists/about/) with accompanying notes and resources.

## Ideas 

There's a common startup trope that ideas are unimportant, and execution is what counts.  I disagree; I think ideas matter.  They matter because to make anything worthwhile takes time.  And as a founder, I would hate to spend 5 to 10 years of my life doing something that is irrelevant, or uninteresting, or inconsequential.

How do you find a good idea?  How do you find a problem worth solving?  

- Paul Graham's [classic advice](http://www.paulgraham.com/start.html) -- "make something people want" -- is still the best counsel out there for aspiring founders.   

- How do you know when people want the thing you've made?  Marc Andreessen popularized the phrase "[product-market fit](https://pmarchive.com/guide_to_startups_part4.html)" to describe this magical stage in a startup's life. 

- Two sidebars to that are that you should make something *you* want to make (aka commitment) and that you should make something you know *how* to make (aka founder-market fit).

- One way to accomplish all these goals is to "scratch your own itch" -- solve a problem that you've previously faced.  That way you know it's a real problem, you know you want to solve it, and you have some ideas on how.  This is how [Quandl got started](/about#technology).

- Sometimes you need to experiment a bit to learn exactly what resonates.  First Round Review's [interview with Payak Kadakia](https://firstround.com/review/classpass-founder-on-how-marketplace-startups-can-achieve-product-market-fit/) of ClassPass describes this process.

- You don't need to rely on serendipity in your experiments!  [Rahul Vohra has a great post](https://firstround.com/review/how-superhuman-built-an-engine-to-find-product-market-fit/) on how Superhuman systematically d/refined their value prop for their most committed users. 

- Keith Rabois argues, and I agree with him, that you cannot pivot or iterate your way to a bold vision.  Experiments are a useful tactic but they do not replace [strategy](https://twitter.com/rabois/status/870673635375104000).  

- A good summary of all these themes and more can be found in this [conversation](https://greatness.floodgate.com/episodes/andy-rachleff-on-how-to-know-if-youve-got-product-market-fit/transcript) between Andy Rachleff and Mike Maples jr.

- More ideas on ideas: look for [hobbies](https://cdixon.org/2013/03/02/what-the-smartest-people-do-on-the-weekend-is-what-everyone-else-will-do-during-the-week-in-ten-years); look for [narrative violations](http://www.bedrockcap.com/letter); look for [secrets](https://blakemasters.com/post/22866240816/peter-thiels-cs183-startup-class-11-notes).

## Growth

So you have an idea, and you've built a product.  What next?  Growth: by which I mean, getting users, getting revenue, and getting to scale.  Paul Graham famously says that startups are *defined* by [growth](http://www.paulgraham.com/growth.html).

In the early days, there is no formula.  You have to figure out what works slowly, iteratively, often fortuitously.  

- Technical or product-centric founders often spend too much time fine-tuning their product and not enough time talking to customers.  It's important to [get out of the building](https://steveblank.com/2009/10/08/get-out-of-my-building/)!  

- The opposite mistake is bringing large numbers of new users to your product, without recognizing that the product itself is mediocre.  Andy Johns has an excellent post on why this is a [dead end](https://andyjohns.co/a-post-mortem-on-growth-hacking).

- Balancing these two imperatives is tricky but important.  James Currier talks about the [psychology](https://www.nfx.com/post/psychology-startup-growth) that makes this possible.  

- A piece of advice that is almost always applicable (and remains that way far longer than you might think) is Paul Graham's "[do things that don't scale](http://paulgraham.com/ds.html)".  

In the later stages of a startup, it's exactly the opposite.  There is a well-established body of best practices on how to grow a business -- *any* business.  Indeed, the maturation and codification of these techniques is one of the key features of our current startup era.

- There's a finite set of levers you can pull to acquire customers at scale; Andrew Chen [breaks them down](https://andrewchen.co/theres-only-a-few-ways-to-scale-user-growth-and-heres-the-list/).

- Mark Cranney has a comprehensive plan of attack for startups [going to market](https://www.slideshare.net/a16z/go-to-market-bootcamp-for-startups); it's dense and information-rich.

- In a [series](https://andyjohns.co/part-1-a-single-minded-perspective-on-growth/) [of](https://andyjohns.co/part-2-designing-an-organization-that-can-optimize-and-innovate/) [four](https://andyjohns.co/part-3-product-development-for-optimization/) [articles](https://andyjohns.co/part-4-product-development-for-innovation/), Andy Johns describes the tension between optimization and innovation -- which result in incremental and step-function growth, respectively -- and how to design organizations that can do both. 

- Tren Griffin [summarizes](https://25iq.com/2014/05/17/a-dozen-things-ive-learned-about-marketing-distribution-and-sales/) wisdom on distribution from Thiel, Bezos, Ellison and Andreessen; Dan Kaplan [does the same](https://techcrunch.com/2014/03/22/the-real-engines-of-growth-on-the-internet/) for Chudnovsky, Elman, Johns and Chen.

## Metrics

- Before you measure anything, you need a framework to give context to your measurements.  I like the pirate metrics (AARRR) framework covered by Andreas Klinger in this [deck](https://www.slideshare.net/andreasklinger/startup-metrics-a-love-story); it applies to virtually any customer acquisition/conversion/retention process.

- David Skok wrote the [definitive guide](https://www.forentrepreneurs.com/saas-metrics-2/) to SaaS metrics.  Jonathan Hsu covers the next evolution of this, focusing on [growth accounting](https://medium.com/swlh/diligence-at-social-capital-part-1-accounting-for-user-growth-4a8a449fddfc).  Angela Tran does the same for [marketplace KPIs](https://versionone.vc/marketplace-kpi/).

- The point of measurement is of course to improve outcomes.  Andy Johns shows how to do this [systematically](https://firstround.com/review/indispensable-growth-frameworks-from-my-years-at-facebook-twitter-and-wealthfront/).

- For operational benchmarking, I find Insight Partners' periodic tables incredibly useful.  They currently have three: [SaaS sales metrics](https://www.insightpartners.com/blog/insights-periodic-table-of-saas-sales-metrics/), [B2B digital marketing metrics](https://www.insightpartners.com/blog/insights-periodic-table-of-b2b-digital-marketing-metrics/), and [startup operating metrics](https://www.insightpartners.com/blog/insights-periodic-table-of-saas-financial-operating-metrics/).

- Real life is more complicated than simple models suggest.  For example, if you push one metric up, it often pulls another one down.  Don't blindly optimize; be thoughtful in how you use metrics and analytics, [advises Bill Gurley](http://abovethecrowd.com/2012/09/04/the-dangerous-seduction-of-the-lifetime-value-ltv-formula/).

- A question that's always asked is, how good are my metrics?  Is my growth strong enough?  Some high-level attempts at an answer include: the [T2D3 Rule](https://www.battery.com/powered/helping-entrepreneurs-triple-triple-double-double-double-to-a-billion-dollar-company/), the [Quick > 4](https://www.slideshare.net/03133938319/saastr) [Rule](https://www.slideshare.net/03133938319/numbers-that-actually-matter-finding-your-north-star), the [Mendoza Line](https://www.scalevp.com/blog/understanding-the-mendoza-line-for-saas-growth), and the [Rule of 40](https://feld.com/archives/2015/02/rule-40-healthy-saas-company.html).

- Finally, metrics matter for fund-raising.  A16z defines some of the most commonly used (and asked for) [startup](https://a16z.com/2015/08/21/16-metrics/) [metrics](https://a16z.com/2015/09/23/16-more-metrics/).  Gigi Levy-Weiss explains how VCs use these metrics to construct their [investment narrative](https://www.nfx.com/post/how-vcs-see-your-kpis).
