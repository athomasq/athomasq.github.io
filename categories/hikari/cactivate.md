## Cactivate Investment Memo

----

<br/> 

### Summary

I'm leading a syndicate to invest in Cactivate, a very compelling pre-seed startup based in Boston.

Cactivate is a **vertically-integrated AI marketing agency** that delivers a 10x better solution for its client base of SMBs and local service providers. They have **$450k of ARR, growing at 8% mom (2.4x annualized), with best-in-class acquisition and retention metrics**. They also have a unique tech stack and angle of attack that helps them stand out in a crowded and noisy market. The three founders are doing their second startup together; they have complementary skills in SMB marketing, high-velocity software engineering, and AI/ML.

Cactivate is **raising $2M on a SAFE note with a post-money valuation cap of $12M and 20% discount**. I've secured a $200k allocation for my syndicate. I've also introduced Cactivate to a number of seed stage funds across the US and Canada. 

I think this is a great opportunity to invest in a differentiated AI startup in a big market, with clear defensibility coming from data assets and proprietary technology, with genuine customer traction, and at a very reasonable valuation. Read on for more details!

<br/> 

### The Problem

SMBs really struggle with digital advertising. 

80% of global digital ad spend -- close to $500B a year -- is done by small businesses: food & beverage, small e-commerce, local service providers, home improvement and so on. But **they're terrible at it**. Over half of them actually lose money on digital marketing after factoring in their costs. Despite that, over three-quarters of SMBs feel they have no option but to increase their spending on ads to acquire customers. This is broken.


<br/> 

### The Wrong Solution(s)

Some SMBs owners try to **manage their own ad strategy**. But running an effective ad strategy is enormously complicated. You have to design a campaign, create content (images and copy), build target audiences, understand the competition, launch and monitor on multiple platforms (Google, Facebook, many others), set a budget, measure results, iterate and improve. Most owners are **overwhelmed by this complexity**, and give up.

Others **outsource to an ad agency**. But there's a problem of economics. SMBs with $500k to $5M in topline revenue (which is the majority of them; ~3 million in the US B2C sector alone) typically have a budget of $5-8k/mo for advertising. Agency pricing typically starts at a $4-6k/mo retainer, leaving only $1-2k/mo for the actual ad spend. Even a 3:1 return on ad spend (extremely hard to achieve) doesn't break even; it's much worse once you account for COGS. **The math just doesn't work**.

With the advent of LLMs, a number of startups have emerged to build **marketing copilots and assistants**, to help owners place their ads more efficiently. But they're solving the wrong problem!  SMB owners don't want faster execution of ad campaigns, they need strategic direction. It's a decision-layer problem, not an implementation-layer problem: speed is meaningless without proper guidance. To quote a Cactivate customer: "I want someone to **tell me what to do**; not do what I tell them".


<br/> 

### The Right Solution: Cactivate

Cactivate has built an end-to-end, vertically-integrated, AI marketing agency that self-learns. For each of its client companies, the Cactivate platform:

1. ingests company data (product info, customer profile, brand assets); 
2. designs an ad strategy (experimental design, task lists, budget and bid limits);
3. implements it from end to end (audience building, content creation, ad placement);
4. measures the results (performance monitoring, attribution, comparisons); and
5. feeds the performance data back into strategy design (iterative learning).

(The tech stack involves LLMs for unstructured data parsing, Bayesian predictors, multimodal generation for creative assets, agents to interface with ad-network APIs, RAG and fine-tuning in the feedback loop, and proprietary data assets).

Cactivate thus doesn't merely execute advertising tasks; instead, it's constantly learning and improving its advertising *strategy*. And it can do this at **1/10th the cost** of a traditional advertising agency. Cactivate charges $150-200/mo in software fees, plus 5% of ad spend; this means that out of a $5k/mo budget, an SMB can deploy $4.5k/mo on actual ads -- a huge improvement versus the traditional agency model.


<br/> 

### Traction and Financials

Customers love Cactivate. Here are some traction highlights:

* $450k ARR from 180 customers, growing 2.4x yoy
* ACV increased from $1k to $4k over the last 12 months 
* Monthly churn is 2% (top decile for SMB software)
* Exceptional qualitative feedback from happy customers 

They have also built an efficient GTM engine:

* Dogfooding their own product to acquire customers
* $750 CAC, >20:1 LTV:CAC ratio (>3:1 is considered excellent)
* 4-month payback period (<12 months is considered excellent)
* Net burn is ~$35k/mo and they have $600k in the bank. 

Cactivate will reach $1M ARR along with break-even profitability *without any further funding*, but they want to grow faster; hence the current round.


<br/> 

### Round Details and Use of Funds

Cactivate is raising $2M on a SAFE note with a $12M post-money valuation cap and a 20% discount. Given their current traction, technology and market size, I think this is a very reasonable valuation. (My hypothesis is that this valuation is available because the founders are outside the Bay Area and are not plugged into traditional venture networks -- they connected with me via cold email).

The high-level goal with this funding is to **add $2M in ARR by the end of 2025**. This puts them firmly into Series A/B territory ($2.5M total ARR growing 3x yoy, large market, efficient acquisition), while staying within line of sight to profitability at all times. 

The specific use of funds breaks down into two categories. First, there are **high-degree-of-confidence investments** into growth initiatives that have already been tested and proven to work: add inside sales (empirically, a single phone call boosts their conversion rates from 8% to 40% -- currently, it's the founders doing this, which is the bottleneck on growth), add more ad channels (beyond Google and Meta -- each channel means more ad spend to take a slice of), add referral incentives (currently 10-15% of clients come via referrals). Second, there are several **low-cost, high-return experiments** that could unlock even faster growth: agency break fees, value-based not time-based trials, credits pricing model, content marketing for TOFU and so on.


<br/> 

### Market Size 

How big is the market opportunity for disrupting digital ad agencies? I triangulated it a few ways:

* There are between 10k and 50k digital marketing agencies in the US, depending on how you measure. 65% of them have 1-10 employees and 25% are 11-50. 20k agencies x 8 employees x $100k rev/employee = $16B. 

* According to BLS, there are 400k advertising managers in the country at a median wage of $150k; if a quarter of them work at agencies, that's 400k x 150k x 0.25 = $15B. 

* Alphabet and Meta alone make $300B a year from search / feed ads of which >80% comes from SMBs. Assume that half of that is through agencies. The typical agency commission on SMB ad spend is 10-20%. $300B x 0.8 * 0.5 * 0.1 = $12B. 

* There are >30M small businesses in the US of which >3M are B2C and make over $500k in revenue. 3M x $5k ACV = $15B.

The exact numbers don't matter as much as the fact that a few different methods land you in the low **10s of billions of dollars** being spent on this.

<br/> 

### Market Dynamics

There's an interesting ecosystem trend at play here. 

All SMBs, whether ecommerce or service providers or F&B or fashion, have certain "jobs to be done" outside their core product or service; this includes digital storefront, payments and checkout, CRM, email and engagement, content and social media etc. The trend of the past decade-plus is for these jobs to be **outsourced to specialized platforms**. 

Shopify, Hubspot, Klaviyo and Wordpress each "won" and now largely "own" a different job function for SMBs -- payments, CRM, engagement and storefront respectively. But there's **no clear winner managing paid acquisition** at the very top of the funnel, instead it's fragmented across thousands of agencies OR is done manually by millions of business owners. That's the opportunity that Cactivate is targeting.
 
<br/> 

### Macro Trends and Why Now

LLMs are obviously the big macro and tech trend here. LLMs can do tasks that previously required human involvement -- understanding data, crafting strategy, creative design, ad placement and monitoring, learning and improvement. This leads to a 10x price saving for existing agency clients; it also unlocks a much larger audience for whom agency-style ad management is now affordable. The ubiquity of LLMs in the news also means that buyers are receptive and indeed eager to listen to pitches that can transform their business outcomes.

<br/> 

### Competition and Defensibility

Marketing tech is an insanely crowded space and AI apps are a dime a dozen. What is Cactivate's edge in the market? I see a few different sources of defensibility:

* Most startup competitors -- Plai, Otis, Madgicx, RevealBot, Smartly.io -- are still just **thin wrappers**: give them a prompt and they'll generate some content, give them a task and they'll do it. Cactivate does so much more.

* I think there may be a **data learning loop** here. Campaign performance data, both specific to one client and cross-sectional across all clients, allows Cactivate to generate ever better results, leading to ever more data. This is a data asset that competitors (and foundation models) don't have access to, and it mitigates the cold-start problem that plagues most *ab initio* marketing initiatives.

* There's some amount of **first-mover advantage**. Cactivate has been been building the predictive side of their product since 2021.  Also, once a company's specific performance data has been ingested tuned upon, there's not much incentive for them to switch to a rival.

* Dogfooding means that Cactivate probably has **lower acquisition** costs than any competitor; of course this is just a downstream artefact of Cactivate just having a better product.

<br/> 

### Team

Last but most important, the team. (Everything else -- better product, better economics, better acquisition -- ultimately comes down to having a better team.)

Cactivate has three founders. [Wentao Xiao](https://www.linkedin.com/in/wentao-xiao-255a0787/) is the CEO and marketing guy; he has domain expertise doing the exact same style of marketing that Cactivate's customers need, and is "solving his own problem". [Zhe Lu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/zlu-cactivate/) is the lead engineer, with experience at BlackBerry and FactSet; he's a high-throughput, full-stack developer. And [Peng Wu](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonpengwu/) is the AI/ML researcher, with a PhD in EE. They met as students at Northeastern, and this is their second startup together. (The first one was a social shopping app that didn't work out).

I think this is a great founding team for the company: solid background, prior startup experience, complementary skill sets, hustle, pragmatism and resilience. I think they'll win.
