## Setyl Investment Memo

----

<br/> 

### Executive Summary

I'm leading a syndicate to invest in the seed round of Setyl.

Setyl is a UK-based tech startup solving a big problem in a large, underserved market: managing "company assets" for traditional IT departments.  They're at USD 432k ARR growing 2.2x yoy, with sticky customers including NatWest, the NHS and Verisure.

They have line of sight to profitability and don't need the money, but one of their investors, who is also a customer, wants to lead a pre-emptive round at a valuation of USD 12.7M.  It's almost fully subscribed but I've managed to get some allocation, thanks to helping the founder substantially over the years (I invested in their pre-seed as well).  

I'm sharing this with a small number of people I know personally; it will be my first syndicate investment (so you know the bar is going to be high).


### Company Overview: Problem and Solution

Setyl is building a system of record for IT asset management.

"IT" is different from "tech".  While tech has connotations of sophisticated Silicon Valley startups, IT is very different -- the admin departments of schools, hospitals, accounting firms, software and consulting firms, mid-sized companies of every description.  (More Dunder Mifflin than OpenAI!)

These organizations have 100s of "assets" to manage -- physical assets like laptops and printers, office chairs and desks, printers and routers, plus digital assets like software licenses, subscriptions and contracts.  

Today, these assets are invariably tracked by hand -- by individual IT managers working with Excel and Google Sheets, if not paper ledgers and files.  It's tedious, time-consuming, and inefficient.  

Setyl automates this.  They have built a SaaS solution that makes it easy for managers to track asset ownership, renewals, costs, depreciation, licensing, usage and much more.


### Customers and Traction

Customers like Setyl a lot.  Here are some quotes:

*"a phenomenal tool for internal due diligence" ... "a godsend for helping me organize our office -- I would highly recommend it to anyone" ... "our whole asset management has improved" ... "streamlines our processes completely" ...*

Most relevantly, the current round is being led by a happy customer (see below for details).

Setyl's metrics are strong.  As of 31 July 2023:

* Over 150 customers in over 20 countries.  
* ARR is USD 432,000, up from USD 192,000 in July 2022.  
* Strong upsell and minimal churn leads to NRR of +133% (top tier)  

Once a company joins Setyl, it's very unlikely that they will migrate off it, because all their asset tracking data is on the Setyl platform.   This is a classic "system of record" effect and a big reason I like the company; it manifests in the low churn and high NRR.



### Team and Company

Setyl is incorporated in the UK, and gets most of its revenue from that market; the rest from Europe.  (Which means North America is green field territory for them).

Founder Christopher Batts is a product manager, with experience at the Economist and at tech startups Goji and TeeSpring.  Co-founder Milorad Doljanin is an experienced sales and operations leader, with executive stints at BP, EON and PetroChina.  They're both first-time founders.  

The dev team is distributed across Serbia, Georgia and Portugal, low cost centres for engineering work that are still easily accessible and in nearby time zones.  They have a tiny sales and marketing team in the UK.



### Growth Philosophy

Christopher and Milorad don't want to get on the VC treadmill.  Rather than "grow at all costs", they prefer to "grow while controlling their own destiny".  This means keeping expenses low, raising small amounts of capital at reasonable valuations, and staying profitable or close to it.  Their growth so far has been achieved with minimal investment in marketing (a small monthly lead budget) and largely founder-driven sales.  I've watched them follow this philosophy even during the height of the tech funding bubble, and I think it makes even more sense today.

I don't expect Setyl to print rapid paper markups from follow-on VC investors; rather, I expect them to build a solid, sustainable, valuable business for the medium term.  That being said, there are some low hanging fruit available with a little investment today (content and SEO, more spend on leads, and hiring a couple more sales and ops reps), which brings us to the current round.


### Financing and Round Details

Sety is raising USD 1M in a priced equity round, at a pre-money of USD 12.7M.  (Note that the actual deal will be priced in GBP -- I'm using 1.27 for exchange rate).  There's a single share class, owned by founders and investors alike.

The round is being led by James Isilay, the CEO of Cognism (a venture-backed startup with a valuation of ~USD 500M).  Cognism was one of Setyl's early customers; James subsequently liked the product so much that he became an angel investor in Setyl's pre-seed round.  He's now leading the seed round and joining Setyl's board.  Cognism sells to almost exactly the same customer profile as Setyl, at much larger scale, so James' operational advice and audience knowledge will be valuable as Setyl grows.

Setyl's current net burn is USD 35k/month and they have USD 400k in the bank (including anticipated tax credits).  So they have over 12 months runway, and even if growth slows, they will be profitable by the end of that period.  So they don't need to raise money.  But they're pragmatic: they're open to taking money if it's on the table, especially at reasonable terms from value-add investors like James.

### My Involvement

I invested in Setyl's friends and family round and have watched them progress from prototype with negligible revenue, to where they are today.  I can vouch for the company's progress on multiple fronts - product, technology, customers, reputation and more.  I can also vouch for the founders' integrity, commitment, responsibility, and ability to execute.  

I'm not a passive investor; I've been actively helping and advising Setyl as they grow.  Specifically, I've been helping with strategic planning (balancing growth rate, burn rate, cash runway and financing), with growth and go-to-market; and with partnerships.  This help is a big reason I'm getting this allocation; here's what Christopher wrote as a testimonial:

*We have been extremely lucky to have found Abraham as an early angel investor in our company. Heâ€™s been with us from right at the beginning and has consistently provided absolutely on-point advice at each stage, in the most hyper rational way which has been a massive assistance.*

I plan to continue my involvement well beyond this round, so you can be assured of close oversight of the company.


### Aside: Acquisition Offers

Somewhat unusually for its stage, Setyl has received four "legit" acquisition offers in the last year -- one from a large public company, two from PE firms, and one from a late stage tech startup, all working roughly in the "office productivity" space.   (It's a testament to how universal / horizontal the Setyl offering is, that there are so many potential buyers.)  The valuation ranges suggested were comparable and indeed possibly a little bit higher than the current round, but the founders weren't interested in selling.  Nonetheless, this suggests that there's an exit available here if things don't work out; it derisks the investment quite a bit in my view.


### Things I Like

1. Large, unglamorous, underserved market (my favourite kind!).  IT departments simply aren't sexy.  But they have to modernize like everyone else, and Setyl is riding that trend. 

2. Truly horizontal play: sellable to pretty much *any* organization.  This helps on multiple fronts: big TAM, easier GTM, and it opens up acquisition / exit possibilities -- Setyl fits into a large universe of acquirers.

3. Differentiated offering thanks to the focus on "physical" assets (many competitors track SaaS spend instead -- easier to build, customers are other tech companies so easier to sell to in good times, less so today).

4. Super sticky thanks to the "system-of-record" effect: customers rarely churn.  This is perhaps the strongest single point.

5. Large surface area, touching IT, finance, HR and Ops at customer orgs -- again, makes it hard for customers to churn.

6. I like the team: they're hardworking, humble, pragmatic, and likeable.

7. Somewhat immune to AI disruption, thanks to their focus on physical assets and data collection.  

8. Fair price even given the current soft venture market: 30x ARR multiple (12.7 on 430k) for a seed company growing >2x yoy is very reasonable.

9. Asymmetric bet: I think they could exit for anywhere between 50M and 500M, giving plenty of upside, but there's a floor thanks to the existing acquisition interest; I think it's unlikely that investors will lose money from here.


### Risks and Concerns

1. Startups are risky and most startups fail; Setyl is no exception.

2. Right now most of Setyl's customers are small to medium enterprises: 50 to 500 people.  SME budgets are always precarious.  Setyl is moving upmarket (and their entry ACV is steadily ticking higher) but that's a work in progress.

3. There's still a lot of work to be done in their go-to-market and scaling strategy -- it's far from fully baked.  (Which is expected for a seed-stage company.)

4. System-of-record stickiness helps Setyl today, but if a well-funded competitor emerges and attempts a land-grab, the same effect makes it hard for Setyl to take business away from them.

# Footnotes



I've invested 3x my usual angel cheque size into Setyl, which gives you a sense of my commitment).

Quite apart from the gains in efficiency (time saved for IT managers), Setyl has a direct ROI in terms of optimizing usage: they help companies not pay for assets they aren't using, whether physical or digital.


True AI companies tend to be high variance -- lofty valuations, massive capital needs, lots of competition, rapid growth but also potential zeros depending on industry scenarios -- making them tricky for investors.  But non-AI companies are also in a tough spot -- they could be completely disrupted by AI.  Setyl is interesting because it can't be easily disrupted by AI per se -- because of the physical data collection and organization aspect. 

Over the last 3 years, I've tracked / evaluate close to 1000 pre-seed and seed startups.  I'd put Setyl in the top 20, and probably the top 10 of deals that I've seen (noting that I don't chase after the g).  It's not about individual numbers, but rather about the combination of all of them: it's unusual to find a company with this combination of decent growth, low churn, good upsell, efficient burn and very reasonable valuation.

I'm basing the fee structure on 5 AngelList syndicates that I'm a member of.  I like Ben Zises'

There is a 1% annual management fee paid over 7 years to the manager of this SPV (Super Angel Syndicate). Averaged over 10 years, this is 0.7% per year and works out to $70 total for a $1k investment. This is separate from the relatively small setup/admin fee that AngelList charges to handle all legal, tax/accounting, software, compliance and regulatory expenses over the life of the investment. After completing more than 20 SPVs, it is clear to me the amount of work that is involved. First, to secure allocations in often highly competitive rounds (which can be years in the making), then to work with the founders to collect, compile and present the information, prepare, and launch, provide IR support, and ongoing updates to investors. With 350+ investors across SuperAngel SPVs, it has proven to be a substantial time commitment and one that takes me away from other fee opportunities. As we grow, the management fee is extremely helpful in covering the costs involved in leading a top-tier angel fund and syndicate. You can learn more about AngelList SPV fees here and here.
