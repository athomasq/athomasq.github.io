## Ubico Investment Memo

----

<br/> 

### Executive Summary

I'm leading a pre-seed syndicate into Ubico, a Montreal-based B2B SaaS company that builds AI-powered sales automation software for small-to-medium sized businesses.  

Ubico has USD 450k in ARR, 60 customers, and some of the best capital efficiency I've ever seen at pre-seed stage.  They're raising USD 150k at an investor-friendly valuation of USD 6M post. The funds will be used to triple their ARR to USD 1.4M by the end of 2024.

<br/> 

### Company and Product Overview

Ubico provides all-in-one sales automation that includes email marketing, sales engagement and data enrichment capabilities.

Customers specify their target audience in natural language -- for example, "owners of advertising agencies in the Pacific northwest".  Ubico then automatically:

* builds a high-quality list of prospects based on this spec; 
* correlates the list against other buying and intent signals;
* generates custom email campaigns for each prospect using AI for personalization; 
* manages the sendout including complex campaign logic; 
* classifies responses into hot, warm and cool leads; 
* helps with follow-up, calendaring, and logistics.  

<br/> 

### Founder and Team

Ubico's founder and CEO is Philippe Kwiatkowski.  Phil built v1 of Ubico while still at university in Montreal; encouraged by customer traction, he dropped out to build the company full-time.  He is a true "dual threat" founder: technically adept and also strong at sales.  He's supported by a small and motivated team of 2 engineers, 1 sales person and 1 customer support person (no team churn in the last 2 years!).

<br/> 

### Traction and Inflection

Ubico is at USD 450k ARR, growing at 5% MoM, and profitable.  They've achieved this on a total of just USD 75k in financing raised over the life of the company, which is exceptional capital efficiency.  

This efficiency is driven by their customer acquisition engine.  They've recently transitioned from founder-led sales to a repeatable process based on paid demand-gen and inside sales.  Their CAC:LTV ratio is over 5 and payback period is less than 6 months.  (For reference, CAC:LTV > 3 and payback < 12 months are considered the benchmarks for "excellent" SaaS startups).  

<br/> 

### Landscape and Competition

When evaluating application-layer AI companies, I don't want to invest in "thin LLM wrappers" that may have rapid early traction but quickly plateau as competition emerges.  Instead, I look for long-term defensibility stemming from unique or proprietary data assets, deep workflow integration, distribution advantages, and actual technological IP.  Ubico ticks all those boxes.

Ubico also has differentiated positioning: they're not selling to large sales teams or to other tech firms, they're going after the larger but less glamorous audience of everyday business owners -- and their low CAC allows them to service this market where others cannot.

<br/> 

### Financing and Growth Path

Ubico recently hit break-even, and can grow at a decent rate by reinvesting future profits.  But the efficiency of their customer acquisition motion suggests investing more aggressively in growth.  With just USD 100-200k in fresh capital, they can double their sales and product teams, hit USD 1.4M in ARR at close to 3x YoY, and be back at break-even by the end of 2024, which puts them in good shape for a Series A. 


<br/> 

### Things I like

1. Solid product, differentiated positioning, macro tailwinds.
2. Good traction and incredible capital efficiency.
3. Inflection point around non-founder sales.
4. Funds used for efficient growth, not merely covering burn.
5. Investor-friendly valuation (4x NTM multiple).
