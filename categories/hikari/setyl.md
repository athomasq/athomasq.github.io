## Setyl Investment Memo

----

<br/> 

### Executive Summary

I'm leading a syndicate to invest in the seed round of Setyl.

Setyl is a UK-based tech startup with a SaaS product that "manages company assets" for traditional IT departments.  It's a sticky solution for a painful problem in a large and underserved market.

Setyl is currently at USD 425,000 ARR growing 2.2x yoy with 133% net retention.  They're raising USD 1M at a pre-money valuation of USD 12.7M, in a pre-emptive round led by an existing investor.  Setyl doesn't need the money; they will reach profitability without the financing.  

I've managed to get some allocation in the round thanks to helping the founders over the years (I invested in their pre-seed as well). I'm sharing this with a small number of people I know personally; it will be my first syndicate investment.

<br/> 

### Company Overview: Problem and Solution



Setyl is building the system of record for office management -- physical assets like laptops and printers, office chairs and desks, printers and routers, plus digital assets like software licenses, subscriptions and contracts.  

Today, these assets are typically tracked by hand -- by individual IT managers working with Excel and Google Sheets, if not paper ledgers and files.  It's tedious, time-consuming, and inefficient.  

Setyl automates this.  Their SaaS solution makes it easy for IT managers to track asset ownership, renewals, costs, depreciation, licensing, utilization and much more.  It's not just about tracking; Setyl generates direct ROI by helping companies optimize usage, not pay for idle assets, time their renewal cycles etc.

### Customers and Traction

Customers love Setyl.  Here are some quotes:

*"a phenomenal tool for internal due diligence" ... "a godsend for helping me organize our office -- I would highly recommend it to anyone" ... "our whole asset management has improved" ... "streamlines our processes completely" ...*

<img src="/assets/img/setyl-3.jpg" class="image">

Setyl's metrics are strong.  As of 31 July 2023:

* Over 150 customers in over 20 countries.  
* ARR is USD 425,000, up from USD 190,000 in July 2022.  
* NRR of +133% reflects strong upsell and minimal churn.

Once a company joins Setyl, it's very unlikely that they will migrate off it, because all their asset data is on the Setyl platform.   This is a classic "system-of-record" effect and a big reason I like the company; it manifests in the low churn and high NRR.

<br/> 

### Team and Company

Setyl is incorporated in the UK. Founder Christopher Batts is a product manager, with experience at the Economist and at tech startups Goji and TeeSpring.  Co-founder Milorad Doljanin is an experienced sales and operations leader, with executive stints at BP, EON and PetroChina.  They're both first-time founders.  I like them -- they are thoughtful, practical, keen and hardworking.

The rest of the team is split between the UK and low-cost dev centres in Europe.  It's still a small team with low burn.

<br/>

### Market

Setyl's sweet spot is mid-market organizations: 300 employees (+/- 200).  They're getting really good traction in this tier.

The product is truly horizontal: customers include schools, hospitals, software firms, banks, a security company, and more.  As such there's a massive TAM here: pretty much every organization has office assets to manage.

<br/> 

### Growth Philosophy

Christopher and Milorad don't want to be tied to the VC treadmill.  Rather than "grow at all costs", they prefer to "grow while controlling their own destiny".  This means keeping expenses low, raising small amounts of capital at reasonable valuations, and staying profitable or close to it.  

As a result they have optionality: they can raise follow-on venture capital (Series A at 1.5-2M ARR) to accelerate growth if they want to, but they can also build a solid, sustainable, cash-efficient business if they choose; they're not locked into either path.

Growth so far has been achieved with minimal investment in marketing (a small monthly lead budget) and largely founder-driven sales.  But there are some low hanging fruit available with a little investment today (content and SEO, more spend on leads, and hiring a couple more sales and ops reps), which brings us to the current round.

<br/> 

### Financing and Round Details

Setyl is raising USD 1M in a priced equity round, at a pre-money of USD 12.7M.  (Note that the actual deal will be priced in GBP -- I'm using 1.27 as the exchange rate).  There's a single share class, owned by founders and investors alike.

The round is being led by James Isilay, the CEO of Cognism (a venture-backed startup that he took from 0 to 50M ARR in a very short time).  Cognism was one of Setyl's earliest (cold outbound) customers; James subsequently became an angel investor in Setyl's pre-seed round.  He's now leading the seed round and joining Setyl's board.  Cognism sells to almost exactly the same audience profile as Setyl, at much larger scale, so James' operational advice and customer knowledge will be valuable as Setyl grows.

Setyl doesn't need the money.  But the founders are pragmatic: they're open to taking an offer if it's on the table, especially at reasonable terms from value-add investors like James.

<br/> 

### My Involvement

I invested in Setyl's friends and family round and can vouch for the company's progress on multiple fronts since then -- product, technology, customers, revenue, reputation and more.  I can also vouch for the founders' integrity, commitment, responsibility, and ability to execute.  

I'm not a passive investor; I've been actively helping and advising Setyl as they grow.  Specifically, I've been helping with strategic planning; with growth and go-to-market; and with partnerships.  This help is a big reason I'm getting this allocation; here's what Christopher wrote as a testimonial:

*We have been extremely lucky to have found Abraham as an early angel investor in our company. Heâ€™s been with us from right at the beginning and has consistently provided absolutely on-point advice at each stage, in the most hyper rational way which has been a massive assistance.*

I will continue my involvement beyond this round, so you can be assured of close oversight of the company.

<br/> 

### Aside: Acquisition Offers

Somewhat unusually for its stage, Setyl has received four "legit" acquisition offers in the last year -- one from a public tech company, two from PE firms, and one from a late stage tech startup, all working roughly in the "office productivity" space.   (It's a testament to how universal / horizontal the Setyl offering is, that there are so many potential buyers.)  

The valuation ranges suggested were comparable and indeed possibly a little bit higher than the current round, but the founders weren't interested in selling.  Nonetheless, this suggests that there's an exit available here if things don't work out; it derisks the investment quite a bit in my view.

<br/> 

### Things I Like

1. Large, unglamorous, underserved market (my favourite kind!).  IT departments simply aren't sexy.  But they have to modernize like everyone else, and Setyl is riding that trend. 

2. Truly horizontal play: sellable to pretty much *any* organization.  This helps on multiple fronts: big TAM, easier GTM, and it opens up acquisition / exit possibilities -- Setyl fits into a large universe of acquirers.

3. Differentiated offering thanks to the focus on "physical" assets (many competitors track SaaS spend instead -- easier to build, customers are other tech companies so easier to sell to in good times, but less so today).

4. Super sticky thanks to the "system-of-record" effect: customers rarely churn.  This is perhaps the strongest single point.

5. Large surface area, touching IT, finance, HR and Ops departments, with self-serve usage by all of these, not siloed in IT -- again, makes it hard for customers to churn.

6. I think well of the team: they're hardworking, humble, pragmatic, and likeable.

7. Somewhat immune to AI disruption, thanks to their focus on physical assets and data collection.  

8. Frugal and efficient; close to profitability; not dependent on capital markets or venture funding to survive.

9. Fair price given market conditions: 12.7M is median for (non-AI) seed rounds today, but most seed startups don't have anywhere close to Setyl's traction.  The combination of 430k ARR, >2x growth, 133% NRR, low burn and large market is quite rare.

10. Asymmetric bet: I think there's a floor on value thanks to the existing acquisition interest, which makes this an asymmetric bet -- lots of upside, limited downside.

<br/> 

### Risks and Concerns

1. Startups are risky and most startups fail; Setyl is no exception.

2. There's still a lot of work to be done in their go-to-market and scaling strategy -- it's far from fully baked.  (Which is expected for a seed-stage company.)

3. For dollar-based investors, there is (hedgeable) currency risk since Setyl is a UK-based and GBP-denominated company.

### Footnotes


2. Setyl started out in the SME segment but has since moved up to the mid-market tier which is their current sweet spot.  They're still building out features required to capture true enterprise customers.

5. System-of-record stickiness helps Setyl retain existing customers, but it doesn't necessarily help them acquire new customers; in that respect, it's not a full-fledged network effect.


I've invested 3x my usual angel cheque size into Setyl, which gives you a sense of my commitment).


True AI companies tend to be high variance -- lofty valuations, massive capital needs, lots of competition, rapid growth but also potential zeros depending on industry scenarios -- making them tricky for investors.  But non-AI companies are also in a tough spot -- they could be completely disrupted by AI.  Setyl is interesting because it can't be easily disrupted by AI per se -- because of the physical data collection and organization aspect. 

Over the last 3 years, I've tracked / evaluate close to 1000 pre-seed and seed startups.  I'd put Setyl in the top 20, and probably the top 10 of deals that I've seen (noting that I don't chase after the g).  It's not about individual numbers, but rather about the combination of all of them: it's unusual to find a company with this combination of decent growth, low churn, good upsell, efficient burn and very reasonable valuation.

I'm basing the fee structure on 5 AngelList syndicates that I'm a member of.  I like Ben Zises' explanation of his fees for the Super Angel Syndicate:

There is a 1% annual management fee paid over 7 years to the manager of this SPV (Super Angel Syndicate). Averaged over 10 years, this is 0.7% per year and works out to $70 total for a $1k investment. This is separate from the relatively small setup/admin fee that AngelList charges to handle all legal, tax/accounting, software, compliance and regulatory expenses over the life of the investment. 

After completing more than 20 SPVs, it is clear to me the amount of work that is involved. First, to secure allocations in often highly competitive rounds (which can be years in the making), then to work with the founders to collect, compile and present the information, prepare, and launch, provide IR support, and ongoing updates to investors. With 350+ investors across SuperAngel SPVs, it has proven to be a substantial time commitment and one that takes me away from other fee opportunities. As we grow, the management fee is extremely helpful in covering the costs involved in leading a top-tier angel fund and syndicate.
