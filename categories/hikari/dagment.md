## Dagment Investment Memo

----

<br/> 

### Summary

I'm leading a pre-seed round to invest in Dagment, a data business.

Dagment is pre-revenue, but has what I think is the best product I've seen in their space, with a strong and dedicated founder, a very big market opportunity, and a compelling valuation of USD 2M.  

This is a business I've been looking for, for a long time. 


<br/> 

### Data Opportunity

Dagment collects, unifies and monetizes business data that is theoretically "public" but in practice obscure and scattered.
 
Certain types of business and financial data, for certain types of companies, are widely available.  Large public companies trade on exchanges; they're subject to regulatory filings and scrutiny; they have dedicated investor-relations teams; and they're covered by established data providers like Bloomberg, Factset and S&P.  There's no shortage of information on them.

But these form just a small minority of companies in the world.  There are far more small and mid-sized businesses, and privately-held companies; they exhibit more variety in their business models and operations; and they rarely disclose information.  Yet there is genuine demand for information about these companies -- from vendors (for sales), from customers (for supply chain management), from financial institutions (for credit), from recruiters and employees, from service providers, and many more.

While information on these companies is hard to find, it does exist. These companies disclose a lot of data to their local and federal governments (incorporation, registration, taxes, compliance, employment, pensions).  This data is in theory public, but the challenge is that it is scattered across 1000s of databases, across 1000s of organizations, badly structured, undocumented and messy.  This is the data opportunity that Dagment is going after.


<br/> 

### Product Overview

Dagment's pitch is simple: "public business data, done right".

Dagment has built a comprehensive knowledge graph of business data sourced from over 90,000 primary government sources across multiple languages.  (They use no third-party providers).  The data is structured and harmonized, with daily updates and 6+ years of history.  It's made availabe via API as well as web interface.

<!--
This all sounds easy, but it is astonishingly hard to do correctly.
-->  

The devil is in the details, and there are a *lot* of details to get right.  I've evaluated dozens of similar businesses over the years, and built similar systems at Quandl (my own startup, now part of Nasdaq).

<!--
I believe Dagment to be best-in-class in terms of their product, data design, and data coverage / quality / accuracy.

I asked a friend of mine who happens (coincidentally) to be one of the world's leading experts on public business data to evaluate Dagment's founder, product and tech, and he concurred with my positive evaluation.

### Founder and Company Details

Dagment's founder is Ivan Pratasevich.  He is a third-time founder; his previous ventures were a music affiliate site, and a website monitoring SaaS, both moderately successful.  He's spent the last several years working on business data and refining the Dagment idea.

Ivan has a very clear and compelling vision of what he wants to build; is extremely dedicated; frugal and pragmatic; direct and candid.  

<!--
I like him and think he is the right person to build this business.
-->

Ivan has also spent some time finding exactly the right team to support him.  Most importantly, Siarhei Averburh who heads data classification and Volha Hrodnikava who runs data ops -- from my personal experience, these are critical roles where you need a very specific set of skills.

Dagment is still pre-revenue.  They've spent most of their time to date building out their product and collecting data.  (This is a common pattern for data businesses -- see my essay [The Economics of Data Businesses](https://pivotal.substack.com/p/economics-of-data-biz) for more.)

<!--
An interesting side-note here is that Dagment is poised to benefit from the ongoing revolution in AI.
-->

High-quality, well-structured, hard-to-replicate training data is one of the most valuable assets in the world, and Dagment has carved out precisely such an asset.  (See my other essay [Data in the Age of AI](https://pivotal.substack.com/p/data-in-the-age-of-ai) for more.)

The company is incorporated in Delaware.  The team is global / remote (mostly in Eastern Europe).  Customers are global.


<br/> 

### Investment Round Details

Dagment is raising up to USD 250k, at a pre-money valuation of USD 2M.  

It's riskier than my other syndicate investments so far, because there's no revenue traction yet.  So this is largely a bet on the founder, the market, and the product vision.  There's also some geographic friction from being based largely in Eastern Europe. These risks are reflected in the very investor-friendly price.

The upside is also higher than most.  There are a number of data businesses focusing on similar (but often more constrainted) data assets, that are worth USD 1-10 billion or more: Dun & Bradstreet, Bureau van Dijk (Moody's), 6sense, Preqin, Pitchbook, CoStar, ZoomInfo, Apollo, Experian, Equifax.  

Of course that's a best-case outcome, but I think the risk-reward here is very compelling.  I'm leading this round myself, via my syndicate.

<!--
About half of the USD 250k is already verbally committed.

Please note that this is a time-constrained round: commitments must be made and wires received by Friday 13 September.

Dagment is pre-revenue, but has a well-designed, valuable and hard-to-replicate product; a dedicated domain-expert founder; a large market opportunity; and an investor-friendly entry valuation of USD 2M.  

This is a business I've been looking for, for a long time.  Read the memo to learn more!

# Flaws with Existing Solutions

Existing providers of data on private companies have limitations:

- some are constrained to specific verticals: data on venture-backed startups, for example, or data on real estate holdings.

- some are constrained to specific user applications: for example, employee lists and contact information for sales prospecting.

- some limit themselves to specific types of data or data sources: scraping LinkedIn, for example.

- some are broad and horizontal, but rely on legacy tech, and as a result their data simply isn't as good.

Despite these limitations, a number of these data businesses have hit 1-10 billion (or more) in enterprise value: Dun & Bradstreet, Bureau van Dijk (Moody's), 6sense, Preqin, Pitchbook, CoStar, ZoomInfo, Apollo, Experian, Equifax etc.

I've been looking for a long time for a next-gen data company that moves beyond these limitations.  I've evaluated over 30 such startups in just the last few years, hyperfocused on this one problem.  Dagment is the most convincing one I've seen, by far.
