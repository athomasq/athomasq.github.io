## Syndicates FAQ for Investors

----

<br/>

## I. Introduction to Syndicates

<br/>

**1. What is a startup syndicate?**  

A startup syndicate is a structure where a group of investors pool their money in order to invest in a tech startup.

<br/>

**2. What are the component of a syndicate?**

A syndicate has several pieces:

* A **syndicate lead** who identifies and evaluates startups to invest into; does all the diligence and negotiates terms; coordinates the  capital-raise from other investors; and acts as the point of contact for the founder.

* One or more **syndicate investors** who put their money into the syndicate and get returns.  

* The **investee company**, the startup that receives money from the syndicate.  

* A **syndicate administrator** who manages all the paperwork, reporting, wire processing, distributions etc. (I use a company called AngelList as my syndicate administrator).  


<br/>

**3. How does the process work?**

A typical syndicate investment process has the following steps:

1. The syndicate lead **identifies a promising startup** and negotiates investment terms with the founder.

2. The syndicate lead shares a **deal memo** with the syndicate investors, laying out the case for investment, including a **decision deadline** and minimum **cheque size**.  

3. Syndicate members **choose whether or not to participate** in the deal, and if they participate, how much they will invest.

4. Syndicate members **wire their investment amounts** to the administrator.  The administrator sets up a "special purpose vehicle" which receives these funds and acts as the investment entity for the syndicate.

5. Once the target allocation has been met and all funds have been received, the **syndicate is closed**. The administrator sends the funds to the investee company, and the company issues securities in the name of the SPV.

6. The company grows and progresses.  The syndicate lead sends **company updates** to all investors, typically once every 6-12 months.

7. After several years, the company either **succeeds or fails**. In the case of a successful exit (an acquisition, IPO, or buyout), the syndicate's shares or notes are bought out or redeemed for cash.  

8. The administrator winds down the SPV and **distributes the proceeds** to all the syndicate members.

<br/>

**4. What are the advantages of syndicates?**

Investors like syndicates because they get access to opportunities they wouldn't otherwise get; they benefit from the syndicate lead's network, evaluation and expertise; they can invest small cheques; and they can build a diversified startup portfolio relatively easily.  

Startups like syndicates because it's more convenient than raising money from lots of individual investors.

<br/>

**5. What are the costs associated with syndicate investing?**

Syndicates typically have a setup fee and a success fee:

* The syndicate administrator charges a fixed one-time **setup fee** -- typically, $8k to $10k -- to handle all legal, tax/accounting, software, compliance and regulatory expenses over the life of the investment.  

* The syndicate lead receives a **success fee**, sometimes known as the "carry" -- typically, 20% of all net profits after fees.

Two things to note here:

* The setup fee is deducted from the investment amount that the company receives.  For example, if the syndicate raises $100k and has $10k in setup fees, the company only receives $90k (and issues $90k worth of securities).

* The success fee is charged on proceeds *after the initial investment and all other fees have been paid back*.  In other words, investors pay either a success fee on winners, or the setup fee, but they don't pay both.

## II. My Syndicate

<br/>

**6. So, you lead a syndicate?**

Yes.  I've been angel investing for many years, quite successfully.  I was often asked whether there was any way for friends and associates to invest alongside me.  So, in late 2023, I decided to launch my own syndicate.  I've led 2 syndicate investments so far, and plan to do 4-6 a year for the next few years.

<br/>

**7. Can you tell me more about your angel investing?**

I've been angel investing for over a decade, and have invested into over 35 companies.  

These days I spend 60-75% of my time solely on angel investing: cultivating dealflow and networks, meeting founders, evaluating new companies, making investments, and actively helping my existing portfolio companies with advice, problem-solving, introductions, you name it.  

It's a lot of work, but very rewarding both intellectually and financially!

<br/>

**8. What's your track record as an angel?**

Pretty good! As of 30 June 2024, my portfolio has an IRR (internal rate of return) of 29% per annum.  7 of the 35 companies I've invested in are tracking to be "big wins" (3 already realized), with a further 4-6 that I'm optimistic will join the club.  12 of the 35 are likely to be zeroes.  For the rest, it's too early to tell.

The first cohort, companies invested in between 2014 and 2017, is at a 5x multiple, 4x cash return (ie not just paper markups), and 32% IRR.  The second cohort, 2019 to 2021, is at 2x and 29%.  The third cohort, 2022 to present, is at 1.2x and 15% (just getting started). 

You can read detailed portfolio statistics [here](https://abrahamthomas.info/portfolio-statistics/).  Note that performance for the first cohort is "realized" (ie, cash returned) but for the other two cohorts it's still largely on paper.  This is typical for early-stage investments: it takes time for the returns to materialize.  

Of course, past performance is no guarantee of future returns :)  

<br/>

**9. What do you invest in?**

I invest in very early stage (pre-seed and seed) tech startups, primarily in North America, with some in Europe.  I have a preference for B2B companies, mostly software and data, platforms and infrastructure, vertical saas, marketplaces, AI/ML etc -- these are sectors where I have good dealflow as well as genuine expertise.  I have developed (and continue to develop) detailed investment theses in each of these areas.

I avoid sectors where I don't have sufficient expertise or experience: this includes healthcare, pharma, biotech, gaming, hardware, mobility, cybersecurity and crypto.  I also avoid most consumer startups.  

My investment philosophy can be summed up in a single (lengthy) sentence: 

*I invest in founders of impeccable character and exceptional ability, solving meaningful problems, often with genuine technical innovation, in markets with strong macro tailwinds, building businesses with compounding structural advantages, that are nonetheless underappreciated by other investors.*  

(Happy to unpack this in detail over a coffee, beer, or zoom).

<br/>

**10. Where do you find companies to invest in?**

I consciously cultivate a few different sources of dealflow:

* I write a newsletter on data, investing and startups, with nearly 5000 high-quality subscribers  
* I get a lot of referrals from my portfolio founders and their second-order connections  
* I also get a lot of referrals from VC firms and later-stage investors
* I have a growing reputation as an former founder turned angel, especially outside the Bay Area ecosystem  
* I've built a network of co-investors -- angels, pre-seed funds etc -- who share dealflow with me  
* I have a strong personal brand as an expert on all things data  

Putting it all together, I look at about 500 startups a year, and invest in 4-6 of them.

<br/>

**11. Do you work with the companies after you invest?**

Yes. I try to be a "value-added" investor, bringing help beyond just my dollars.  This help can take the form of advice, introductions, tactical problem-solving, planning and strategy, follow-on fund-raising, and more.  

I speak with most of my portfolio founders at least once every 1-2 months; manage a portfolio Slack group; write regular strategy and market memos; and host 1-2 founder dinners every year.  All of this also allows me to stay on top of progress (or problems) at my portfolio companies.  

<br/>

**12. Where can I learn more?**

My [investing page](https://abrahamthomas.info/investing/) has a lot more info about my angel investing, track record, portfolio companies, performance, founder testimonials and more.  

<br/>

**13. How do I join your syndicate?**

Here's a link to my [syndicate page on AngelList](https://angellist.com/s/abraham-thomas/60E6E).  Click on "Back Syndicate" to join.  

**Joining is free, and doesn't oblige you to make any investments**; it merely means that when I share my next deal, you'll receive an email with all the details.  You can decide at that time whether or not to participate in that deal.  

You'll have to create a (free) AngelList account to join, and do some KYC stuff if and when you actually make an investment.

## III. Investing in Syndicates

<br/>

**14. What's the single most important thing I should know?**  

Startups are risky!  Most startups fail!  Only invest what you can afford to lose!  

Also, diversify!  If you're going to angel invest, try to build a portfolio of at least 10 investments, ideally over a period of several years (time diversification).  Any individual company can fail, often through no fault of their own; you want to have enough companies in your portfolio to smoothe out this volatility.

<br/>

**15. What's a reasonable amount to invest?**

Most syndicate investors write cheques between $5k and $25k into each startup they back, though some go as low as $1k and some go as high as $50k.  

Cheque size is a function of two opposing incentives:

* You want to diversify your startup exposure across at least 10 different companies.  Your cheque into any one startup should be at most 1/10th of your total allocation to this sector.

* At the same time, you don't want your cheque size to be so small that it doesn't move the needle for you even if it succeeds.  

If in doubt, it's better to start small and increase your cheque size, than the other way around.  


<br/>

**16. How many syndicated deals should I invest in?**

For most investors, doing 2-4 syndicate investments a year for 3-5 years is a sensible cadence. 

You want to invest in enough deals to get the benefits of diversification, while keeping your standards high (i.e. not investing in mediocre deals).  You also want to invest over a period of time: this smoothes out your cash flows (both inward and outward), and it insulates against ebbs and flows in the venture market.  


<br/>

**17. What's a reasonable expectation around returns?**

Historically, top-performing venture portfolios **return 3-5x** the capital invested, over a 7-10 investment horizon; that works out to between 12% and 25% IRR.  That's roughly what I'm targeting in my syndicate portfolio as well.

Startup outcomes famously follow a "power law".  Startups are incredibly risky; most startups fail; hence most investments go to zero.  But a small handful succeed, and the successes can return 10x, 100x or more.  The goal of any venture portfolio is for the successes to outweigh the failures.  This is why you need to diversify: get enough shots at goal so that at least some of them will go in. 

<br/>

**18. What's a reasonable expectation around timing?**

Startups are illiquid, and take time to produce returns.  The median time to exit for successful startups is **7-10 years** (and getting longer).  So you should not expect to have access to your cash for a long time after you invest.  Again, don't invest any money into a syndicate that you are not comfortable losing.

<br/>

**19. Can I pick and choose which investments to participate in?**

Absolutely.  Joining the syndicate merely means that you'll be on the mailing list for all deal memos that I share (4-6 a year).  You can then choose whether or not to invest in these companies, on a deal-by-deal basis.  

<br/>

**20. What information can I expect after I invest?**

It varies from syndicate to syndicate.  Most syndicate leads share high-level company updates once or twice a year; that's what I do myself.
