## Introduction to Syndicates

----

<br/> 

*This is not investment advice; it's not an offer to buy or sell securities or anything else; it's just a simplified description of how syndicates work.*

<br/>

**What is a syndicate?**  

A syndicate is a structure where a group of investors pool their money into a joint entity, and that entity in turn invests in a deal (which could be a startup, private company, project, asset, property, whatever).

A syndicate has several pieces:

* A syndicate lead who does all the investment-related work -- sourcing, evaluation, diligence, setting terms, getting allocation in the deal, helping the company post-investment, raising capital from investors, keeping them informed, etc.   

* A syndicate administrator or platform (like AngelList) that manages all the logistics, filings, compliance, entity setup, payment processing, fee calculations, distributions etc.  

* Syndicate investors who put their money into the syndicate and get returns.  

<br/>

**Why use syndicates?**

Investors like syndicates because:  
* they get access to investment opportunities that they would not otherwise get;  
* they benefit from the syndicate lead's dealflow, judgement, allocation and expertise;  
* it's more convenient than writing cheques directly into startups;  
* they can invest smaller amounts than if they were doing direct investments;
* syndicates help them diversify across multiple startups.

Leads like syndicates because:  
* they get to deploy more capital into each investment opportunity;  
* they receive success fees if the investment does well.  

Startups like syndicates because:
* they don't have to raise money from lots of small investors;  
* they don't have to manage dozens of entries on their cap table.

And of course the syndication platform is compensated via setup and admin fees.

<br/>

**How does it all work?**

A typical syndicate investment process looks like this:

1. The syndicate lead shares a deal memo laying out the case for investment, including a decision deadline and minimum cheque size.  

2. Syndicate members choose whether or not to participate in the deal, and if they participate, in what size.  

3. Once committed, syndicate members wire their investment to the administator (AngelList).  AL setups up a "special purpose vehicle" which is the investment entity for the syndicate.

4. Once all funds have been received and the deal allocation is filled, the syndicate is closed; AL then sends the funds to the investee company, and the company issues securities (shares or notes) to the SPV.

5. On exit (acquisition, IPO, buyout), the shares or notes are bought or redeemed for cash, which is sent to the SPV.  

6. The administrator winds down the SPV and distributes the proceeds (after fees) to all the syndicate members, pro rata based on their ownership.

<br/>

**What are the fees?**

There are three sets of fees associated with investing in a syndicate: setup fee, management fee, and success fee aka carry.  

* The syndicate administrator charges a fixed one-time setup fee -- typically, $8k to $15k -- to handle all legal, tax/accounting, software, compliance and regulatory expenses over the life of the investment.  

* The syndicate lead charges an annual fee -- typically, 0.5-2% of the syndicate size, over a 7 to 10 year investment lifespan -- to cover their own expenses and time invested.

* The syndicate lead receives a success fee or "carry" -- typically, 20% of all profits after the initial investment plus all fees have been repaid.

The success fee is charged on proceeds after all other fees have been paid back.  In other words, investors will either pay a success fee on winners, or they will pay the setup and management fee, but they won't pay both.

<br/>

**What's a reasonable amount to invest?**

Every investor is different, and every syndicate is different.  Most people decide their cheque size by balancing three factors:

* Startups are risky, so you want to diversify your startup exposure across at least 10 different companies.  So your cheque into any one syndicate should be at most 1/10th of your total startup allocation.  And then you should be prepared to invest in 9 more companies, over a period of time.

* At the same time, you don't want your cheque size to be so small that it doesn't move the needle for you -- eg if you invest $100 in a syndicate and it returns 4 times your money, is the $400 of proceeds worth the time, effort, mental bandwidth etc?  Each investor will have a different view of what returns make it worthwhile for them.

* You don't want to be too large a proportion (say >25%) of the funds in any one syndicate. 

Putting it all together, most syndicate investors end up writing cheques between $10k and $50k for each syndicate they back.  

<br/>

**How many syndicated deals should I invest in?**

Syndicate investors can choose whether or not to participate in the deals brought to them by the syndicate lead on a deal-by-deal basis.  In this regard, a syndicate is different from a fund; in a fund, all investors necessarily participate in all the investments that the fund makes.

Some syndicates are very active, bringing dozens of deals to their members every year.  Others are more opportunistic, doing just 2-3 deals at irregular intervals.  Many early-stage tech / startup syndicates fall in the range of 4-12 investments a year. 

As an investor, you want to  balance doing enough deals to get the benefits of diversification, while keeping your standards high and not investing in poor-quality deals.  You also want to invest over a period of time: this smoothes out your cash flows (both in and out), and it insulates against ebbs and flows in the venture market.  

Putting it all together, for most investors, doing 3-4 syndicate investments a year for 3-4 years is a sensible cadence.


<br/>

**What's a reasonable expectation around returns?**

Technology startups are incredibly risky.  In fact, most startups fail.  You should expect many and perhaps most of your startup investments to go to zero.  (This is normal and expected behaviour for any startup portfolio.)  Therefore, you should not invest any money into a syndicate that you are not comfortable losing.

On the other hand, the startups that succeed, can sometimes be massive successes.  It's possible for the winners to return 5x, 10x or more on the money that early investors put in.  The bet you're making as a startup investor is that the gains from the small handful of winners will outweigh the losses from the large number of loses.  (And this is a big reason why it's important to diversify across multiple investments.)

Also note that startups are extremely illiquid, and take time to produce returns.  The median time to exit for successful startups is 7 years (and getting longer).  So you should not expect to have access to your cash for a long time after you invest.  Again, don't invest any money into a syndicate that you are not comfortable losing.

<br/>

**What information can I expect after I invest?**

Not a lot.  Unlike public companies, startups don't have to report financials or provide updates.  And candidly, keeping small investors up-to-date on the nuances of company progress isn't always the best use of founder time.  At best you can expect high-level yearly summaries; equally, you may hear nothing at all for 5 years and then suddenly wake up to the news of a successful exit and cash in the bank (this has happened to me!).

<br/>

**Will I be able to speak to the founder(s) before I invest?**

Probably not.  It's not a good use of founder time to pitch individual small-cheque investors; that negates the whole attraction of the syndicate model from their point of view.
