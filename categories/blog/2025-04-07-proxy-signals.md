## Proxy Signals

----

<br/>

Team character and macro trends are, by far, the most important criteria when making an early stage investment.  Everything else -- product, tech, pricing, GTM, ICP -- can change.  But you can't change the founding team, and you can't change the macro.

It's possible for an investor to understand (or learn) macro trends, even across industries where they have limited context; this is part of what a good pitch deck does.  

But how do you evaluate founder character?  By which I mean: tenacity and resilience, speed of execution, vision and imagination, raw intellectual horsepower, competitiveness and winning habits, curiosity and optimism, ability to lead and inspire, ability to sell... 

That too, in a 25-50 minute initial meeting, filtered down from 100s of potential contacts.  It's hard, and most investors suck at it.

Instead, they use proxy signals, which is worse.  Here are some examples:

* If a founder talks or walks fast, that must mean they think and act fast  
* If a founder is rude or arrogant, that must mean they're competitive and like to win  
* If a founder is weird or oblivious, that must mean they're original and creative  
* If a founder wears a hoodie or black turtleneck, that must mean they're Zuckerberg or Jobs  

... and so on.

Now, some of these correlations may actually hold in a vacuum.  But we don't live in a vacuum; we live in a repeated game.  Solve for the equilibrium!

The problem is: all of these signals are easy to fake.  It's a lot easier to talk fast than to actually think fast, in depth, and correctly.  It's a lot easier to act rude than to actually win.  And so ambitious, cynical, game-maxing founders mimic all these signals, and sadly, the median over-worked, under-experienced VC is taken in.

My personal belief is that founder character manifests in the company they build.  But that takes more work...
