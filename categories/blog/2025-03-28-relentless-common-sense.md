## Relentless Common Sense

----

<br/>

**Startups are an exercise in relentless common sense.** 

People think startups are hard.  They are, but not for the obvious reasons.  There are no hidden traps or arcane wisdom, no tricks of the trade or secret sauce that will magically unlock success. 

Instead, startups are about the relentless, consistent, almost ruthless application of common sense and good judgement and clear thinking from first principles.  And I do mean **relentless**: every single hour of every single day.  You can never take a break from the discipline this requires.  That's what makes it hard.
