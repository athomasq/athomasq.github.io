A surprisingly common mistake I see people make is confusing preferences -- what they *want* -- and constraints -- what's *possible*.  

Specifically, they allow the latter to over-ride the former. 

For example: you want to hire a person who you think is really really good (preference).  But you worry that they're too senior, and won't take a paycut to join a tiny startup (constraint).  So you don't even make them an offer!

This is a mistake.  Constraints are externally imposed -- let them be externally imposed!  There's no need to internalize them -- no need to hamstring your own possibilities.  Make the offer!  Who knows, maybe they'll accept; maybe they have other priorities than salary maximization; maybe there's a comp solution that works for both of you.  

And sure, you might get rejected.  If so, you're no worse off than if you had never stepped up in the first place.  But if you just self-censor, you'll never find out.

*Especially* in startups, where outcomes are asymmetric -- just do it.  Don't let (what you imagine to be) the constraints of the situation block you from pursuing your preferences. 

(Why do people continue to make this mistake?  Fear of rejection, plus preference for certain negative value, over uncertain upside.)
