## Hello World!

----

<br/>

"Nor again is there anyone who loves or pursues or desires to obtain pain of itself, because it is pain, but because occasionally circumstances occur in which toil and pain can procure him some great pleasure."  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -- Cicero, *de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum*.  

(Pat yourself on the back if you know why I've used this quote.)

This blog is for thoughts longer and less ephemeral than a [tweet](https://x.com/athomasq), shorter and less elaborate than an [essay](/essays).  Share and enjoy!
