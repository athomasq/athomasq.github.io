## Metrics for Seed Stage Startups

----

<br/>

Between 2015 and 2017, when I was running Quandl and we were becoming more metrics-driven, I collected a set of my favourite articles and memos on startup metrics:

* [Pirate Metrics](https://www.slideshare.net/andreasklinger/startup-metrics-a-love-story) by Andreas Klinger   
Before you measure anything, you need a framework to give context to your measurements.  The Pirate Metrics framework breaks down startup success into 5 steps: Acquisition, Activation, Revenue, Retention, Referral -- AARRR!  

* [SaaS Metrics](https://www.forentrepreneurs.com/saas-metrics-2/) by David Skok
This is the original, definitive guide to SaaS metrics, and defines many of the terms in use today.

* [Growth Accounting](https://medium.com/swlh/diligence-at-social-capital-part-1-accounting-for-user-growth-4a8a449fddfc) by Jonathan Hsu
This is the next evolution of Skok's SaaS metrics, focused on growth accounting.  I also like his idea of "turning the balance sheet sideways"

* [Marketplace KPIs](https://versionone.vc/marketplace-kpi/) by Angela Tran
What Skok does for SaaS, Tran does for marketplaces (but see footnote 1).




- The point of measurement is of course to improve outcomes.  Andy Johns shows how to do this [systematically](https://firstround.com/review/indispensable-growth-frameworks-from-my-years-at-facebook-twitter-and-wealthfront/).

- For operational benchmarking, I find Insight Partners' periodic tables incredibly useful.  They currently have three: [SaaS sales metrics](https://www.insightpartners.com/blog/insights-periodic-table-of-saas-sales-metrics/), [B2B digital marketing metrics](https://www.insightpartners.com/blog/insights-periodic-table-of-b2b-digital-marketing-metrics/), and [startup operating metrics](https://www.insightpartners.com/blog/insights-periodic-table-of-saas-financial-operating-metrics/).

- Real life is more complicated than simple models suggest.  For example, if you push one metric up, it often pulls another one down.  Don't blindly optimize; be thoughtful in how you use metrics and analytics, [advises Bill Gurley](http://abovethecrowd.com/2012/09/04/the-dangerous-seduction-of-the-lifetime-value-ltv-formula/).

- A question that's always asked is, how good are my metrics?  Is my growth strong enough?  Some high-level attempts at an answer include: the [T2D3 Rule](https://www.battery.com/powered/helping-entrepreneurs-triple-triple-double-double-double-to-a-billion-dollar-company/), the [Quick > 4](https://www.slideshare.net/03133938319/saastr) [Rule](https://www.slideshare.net/03133938319/numbers-that-actually-matter-finding-your-north-star), the [Mendoza Line](https://www.scalevp.com/blog/understanding-the-mendoza-line-for-saas-growth), and the [Rule](https://feld.com/archives/2015/02/rule-40-healthy-saas-company.html) of [40](https://medium.com/@speechu/re-imagining-the-rule-of-40-for-early-stage-startups-the-70-growth-efficiency-heuristic-9cca0131b0c5).

- Finally, metrics matter for fund-raising.  A16z defines some of the most commonly used (and asked for) [startup](https://a16z.com/2015/08/21/16-metrics/) [metrics](https://a16z.com/2015/09/23/16-more-metrics/).  Gigi Levy-Weiss explains how VCs use these metrics to construct their [investment narrative](https://www.nfx.com/post/how-vcs-see-your-kpis).  




Footnotes 

I'd add one caveat that "liquidity" is the key underlying driver for all these marketplaces, so it's worth defining and measuring it.  (My favoured definition was "fraction of vendor products that achieved ")
