## Metrics for Seed Stage Startups

### Metrics Articles, 2015-2017

Between 2015 and 2017, when I was running Quandl and we were becoming more metrics-driven, I collected a set of my favourite articles and memos on startup metrics:

*[SaaS Metrics](https://www.forentrepreneurs.com/saas-metrics-2/) by David Skok*  
One of the oldest articles on SaaS metrics, defines many of the terms in use today.

*[Growth Accounting](https://medium.com/swlh/diligence-at-social-capital-part-1-accounting-for-user-growth-4a8a449fddfc) by Jonathan Hsu*  
This is the next evolution of Skok's SaaS metrics, focused on growth accounting.  **Update:** see Metrics 2020 for new thinking on this by Hsu.

*[Marketplace KPIs](https://versionone.vc/marketplace-kpi/) by Angela Tran*  
What Skok does for SaaS, Tran does for marketplaces.

*[Systematic Growth](https://firstround.com/review/indispensable-growth-frameworks-from-my-years-at-facebook-twitter-and-wealthfront/) by Andy Johns*  
The point of measurement is to improve outcomes; Johns shows how to do this systematically.

*Startup Benchmarks: [SaaS Sales](https://www.insightpartners.com/blog/insights-periodic-table-of-saas-sales-metrics) + [B2B Marketing](https://www.insightpartners.com/blog/insights-periodic-table-of-b2b-digital-marketing-metrics/) + [Operating Metrics](https://www.insightpartners.com/blog/insights-periodic-table-of-saas-financial-operating-metrics/)*  
I find Insight Partners' annual "periodic tables" incredibly useful -- they tell you how much you should be spending on sales, onr marketing, on ops, and what kind of returns you should be getting from each of those investments.  **Update:** see Metrics 2020 for latest values.

*[Using Metrics Wisely](http://abovethecrowd.com/2012/09/04/the-dangerous-seduction-of-the-lifetime-value-ltv-formula/) by Bill Gurley*  
Real life is more complicated than simple models suggest; don't blindly optimize; be thoughtful in how you use metrics and analytics.

*How Good Is My Growth?*  
- [The T2D3 Rule](https://www.battery.com/powered/helping-entrepreneurs-triple-triple-double-double-double-to-a-billion-dollar-company/)
- [The Quick 4 Rule](https://www.slideshare.net/03133938319/saastr) 
- [More on Quick 4](https://www.slideshare.net/03133938319/numbers-that-actually-matter-finding-your-north-star)   
- [The Mendoza Line](https://www.scalevp.com/blog/understanding-the-mendoza-line-for-saas-growth)
- [The Rule of 40](https://feld.com/archives/2015/02/rule-40-healthy-saas-company.html) 
- [The 70% Heuristic](https://medium.com/@speechu/re-imagining-the-rule-of-40-for-early-stage-startups-the-70-growth-efficiency-heuristic-9cca0131b0c5)

*[Metrics for Fundraising](https://a16z.com/2015/08/21/16-metrics/) and [More Metrics for Fundraising](https://a16z.com/2015/09/23/16-more-metrics/) by A16z*    
A good checklist of what you should have on hand, if you're going to raise a Series A and beyond.

### Metrics Articles, 2020 onwards

Here are some more recent articles on metrics that I think are worth saving and returning to:

*[The Burn Multiple](https://sacks.substack.com/p/the-burn-multiple-51a7e43cb200) by David Sacks*  
Definitive article on how to think about your overall efficiency.

*[SaaS Org Charts](https://sacks.substack.com/p/the-saas-org-chart) by David Sacks*  
Almost all SaaS companies gravitate towards roughly the same org structure and headcount for a given stage of growth.  Sacks delineates this (with lots of useful numbers); see also [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fz95IEDLv7Q).

*[SaaS Metrics That Matter](https://sacks.substack.com/p/the-saas-metrics-that-matter) by David Sacks*  
The third in a series from David Sacks; a great set of definitions for modern SaaS metrics.

*Updated Benchmarks from Insight Partners*  
[Sales Periodic Table](https://www.insightpartners.com/ideas/saas-sales-periodic-table/) and [Sales KPI Report](https://www2.insightpartners.com/l/321391/2023-05-26/9185b9/321391/1685120105e58IAcZE/2023_Sales_KPI_Report_vFF_Public.pdf) -- unfortunately it doesn't look like they've updated the marketing or ops tables since the first version. (h/t Pete Macnee for the latest links.)

*[Quantitative PMF](https://tribecap.co/a-quantitative-approach-to-product-market-fit/) by Jonathan Hsu*  
*[Unit Economics](https://tribecap.co/unit-economics-and-the-pursuit-of-scale-invariance/) by Jonathan Hsu*  
Two successor articles to his earlier piece on growth accounting; sophisticated and subtle; perhaps of more use to VCs analyzing a business, than the founders actually running it.  In that sense the older piece is more useful.

*[Three Keys to Sales](https://cd.linkedin.com/posts/sam-blond-791026b_the-3-most-important-sales-performance-metrics-activity-7041880724525735936-CSvY) by Sam Blond*  
Simple but critical sales metrics that you should start measuring from day one of sales.

### Spreadsheets and Templates

Here are some spreadsheets that I've built that can act as templates for some of the above:

* Sales and marketing performance model
* Burn and runway model
* ARR and PMF model
* Iron law of sales

Note: I'll add these if somebody asks; they need a bit of cleanup.
