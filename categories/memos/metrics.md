## Metrics for Seed Stage Startups

### Metrics Articles, 2015-2017

Between 2015 and 2017, when I was running Quandl and we were becoming more metrics-driven, I collected a set of my favourite articles and memos on startup metrics:

*[Pirate Metrics](https://www.slideshare.net/andreasklinger/startup-metrics-a-love-story) by Andreas Klinger*   
Before you measure anything, you need a framework to give context to your measurements.  The Pirate Metrics framework breaks down startup success into 5 steps: Acquisition, Activation, Revenue, Retention, Referral -- AARRR!  

*[SaaS Metrics](https://www.forentrepreneurs.com/saas-metrics-2/) by David Skok*  
This is the original, definitive guide to SaaS metrics, and defines many of the terms in use today.

*[Growth Accounting](https://medium.com/swlh/diligence-at-social-capital-part-1-accounting-for-user-growth-4a8a449fddfc) by Jonathan Hsu*  
This is the next evolution of Skok's SaaS metrics, focused on growth accounting.  **Update:** see Metrics 2020 for new thinking on this by Hsu.

*[Marketplace KPIs](https://versionone.vc/marketplace-kpi/) by Angela Tran*  
What Skok does for SaaS, Tran does for marketplaces (but see footnote 1).

*[Systematic Growth](https://firstround.com/review/indispensable-growth-frameworks-from-my-years-at-facebook-twitter-and-wealthfront/) by Andy Johns*  
The point of measurement is to improve outcomes; Johns shows how to do this systematically.

*Startup Benchmarking: [SaaS Sales](https://www.insightpartners.com/blog/insights-periodic-table-of-saas-sales-metrics) + [B2B Marketing](https://www.insightpartners.com/blog/insights-periodic-table-of-b2b-digital-marketing-metrics/) + [Operating Metrics](https://www.insightpartners.com/blog/insights-periodic-table-of-saas-financial-operating-metrics/) from Insight Partners*  
I find Insight Partners' annual periodic tables incredibly useful -- they tell you how much you should be spending on sales, onr marketing, on ops, and what kind of returns you should be getting from each of those investments.  

*[Using Metrics Wisely](http://abovethecrowd.com/2012/09/04/the-dangerous-seduction-of-the-lifetime-value-ltv-formula/) by Bill Gurley*  
Real life is more complicated than simple models suggest; don't blindly optimize; be thoughtful in how you use metrics and analytics.

*How Good Is My Growth?*  
Some high-level attempts at an answer:
- The [T2D3 Rule](https://www.battery.com/powered/helping-entrepreneurs-triple-triple-double-double-double-to-a-billion-dollar-company/)
- Tte [Quick 4 Rule](https://www.slideshare.net/03133938319/saastr) 
- [Quick 4 Revisited](https://www.slideshare.net/03133938319/numbers-that-actually-matter-finding-your-north-star), 
- [The Mendoza Line](https://www.scalevp.com/blog/understanding-the-mendoza-line-for-saas-growth)
- [The Rule of 40](https://feld.com/archives/2015/02/rule-40-healthy-saas-company.html) 
- [The 70% Heuristic(https://medium.com/@speechu/re-imagining-the-rule-of-40-for-early-stage-startups-the-70-growth-efficiency-heuristic-9cca0131b0c5)

*[Metrics for Fundraising](https://a16z.com/2015/08/21/16-metrics/) and [More Metrics for Fundraising from A16z](https://a16z.com/2015/09/23/16-more-metrics/)*    
A good checklist of what you should have on hand, if you're going to raise a Series A and beyond.




Footnotes 

I'd add one caveat that "liquidity" is the key underlying driver for all these marketplaces, so it's worth defining and measuring it.  (My favoured definition was "fraction of vendor products that achieved ")
