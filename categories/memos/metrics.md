## Metrics for Seed Stage Startups

----

<br/>

- Before you measure anything, you need a framework to give context to your measurements.  I like the pirate metrics (AARRR) framework covered by Andreas Klinger in this [deck](https://www.slideshare.net/andreasklinger/startup-metrics-a-love-story); it applies to virtually any customer acquisition/conversion/retention process.

- David Skok wrote the [definitive guide](https://www.forentrepreneurs.com/saas-metrics-2/) to SaaS metrics.  Jonathan Hsu covers the next evolution of this, focusing on [growth accounting](https://medium.com/swlh/diligence-at-social-capital-part-1-accounting-for-user-growth-4a8a449fddfc).  Angela Tran does the same for [marketplace KPIs](https://versionone.vc/marketplace-kpi/).

- The point of measurement is of course to improve outcomes.  Andy Johns shows how to do this [systematically](https://firstround.com/review/indispensable-growth-frameworks-from-my-years-at-facebook-twitter-and-wealthfront/).

- For operational benchmarking, I find Insight Partners' periodic tables incredibly useful.  They currently have three: [SaaS sales metrics](https://www.insightpartners.com/blog/insights-periodic-table-of-saas-sales-metrics/), [B2B digital marketing metrics](https://www.insightpartners.com/blog/insights-periodic-table-of-b2b-digital-marketing-metrics/), and [startup operating metrics](https://www.insightpartners.com/blog/insights-periodic-table-of-saas-financial-operating-metrics/).

- Real life is more complicated than simple models suggest.  For example, if you push one metric up, it often pulls another one down.  Don't blindly optimize; be thoughtful in how you use metrics and analytics, [advises Bill Gurley](http://abovethecrowd.com/2012/09/04/the-dangerous-seduction-of-the-lifetime-value-ltv-formula/).

- A question that's always asked is, how good are my metrics?  Is my growth strong enough?  Some high-level attempts at an answer include: the [T2D3 Rule](https://www.battery.com/powered/helping-entrepreneurs-triple-triple-double-double-double-to-a-billion-dollar-company/), the [Quick > 4](https://www.slideshare.net/03133938319/saastr) [Rule](https://www.slideshare.net/03133938319/numbers-that-actually-matter-finding-your-north-star), the [Mendoza Line](https://www.scalevp.com/blog/understanding-the-mendoza-line-for-saas-growth), and the [Rule](https://feld.com/archives/2015/02/rule-40-healthy-saas-company.html) of [40](https://medium.com/@speechu/re-imagining-the-rule-of-40-for-early-stage-startups-the-70-growth-efficiency-heuristic-9cca0131b0c5).

- Finally, metrics matter for fund-raising.  A16z defines some of the most commonly used (and asked for) [startup](https://a16z.com/2015/08/21/16-metrics/) [metrics](https://a16z.com/2015/09/23/16-more-metrics/).  Gigi Levy-Weiss explains how VCs use these metrics to construct their [investment narrative](https://www.nfx.com/post/how-vcs-see-your-kpis).
