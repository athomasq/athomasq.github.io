title: Sharing Updates With Potential Future Investors
---

#### Should I send investor updates to potential future investors who I've met and who've asked to stay in the loop?

There's a famous blog post by VC Mark Suster saying that investors like to invest in [lines not dots](https://bothsidesofthetable.com/invest-in-lines-not-dots-611f36491d73) -- in other words, they prefer to see progress over a period of time, rather than make a decision based on a one-time snapshot of the company.  (I strongly recommend reading the post).  

Well, obviously that makes sense for the investor receiving the updates -- it derisks them and lets them pick and choose the timing of investment -- they can wait for a clear inflection point on traction, plus they are at an advantage (head-start on diligence etc) relative to other investors who see you for the first time when you "officially" start to raise.  Also it costs them nothing to ask for updates, after all you're the one spending time and effort writing, not them.

But it's not clear that this is good for the founder or the startup.  

On the one hand, sending regular updates probably does make the future round a bit easier to raise (assuming progress is good!  -- if you send regular updates about a business that is struggling, then you just make it harder) (conversely, there's nothing as powerful as saying you're going to do something, and then doing it).  

On the other hand, it probably hurts your valuation a bit, since it makes the round less competitive -- the best way to get a high valuation is to set up an "auction" (competitive bidding) between different VCs, and if one VC has a head-start, that's hard to do.  In fact some VCs will refuse to even consider investing if they feel that they are "too far behind" in the process.  

That being said, *maximizing valuation is not the most important goal* for a founder -- I would always advise picking the "right" investor over picking the highest valuation.  (Better to get a reasonable valuation from an investor you trust and who trusts you and who really understands the business, than a high valuation from someone you've just met.)

So my preferred solution is to create a small list of investors who you really like -- who would be your "dream investors" for the next round -- and send them quarterly updates.  These should just be redacted compilations of your monthly updates -- the trick is to keep them short and sweet and minimize work. 

But don't send updates to everyone who ever expressed interest -- that's just not efficient use of your time, and there's also a risk of becoming "too exposed" -- everyone wants to feel like they are the only ones with access to the next hot deal, they don't want to be just one of 50 people getting the same carbon copy update.  That's why personalization also helps.

For what it's worth -- our Series B was a pre-emptive round that happened thanks to "lines not dots".  We were introduced to a firm around the time of our Series A -- they were interested but couldn't move fast enough.  But I liked them and they liked me, so I met them next time I was in California, and I spoke to the partner every 6 months or so.  I called him shortly after we launched our marketplace (big step forward for the business) and even though we had lots of cash in the bank and weren't raising, he said -- "I've seen enough, I want to lead your Series B right now" (not in exactly those words, but that was the gist).  So it can totally work!  And he was a great investor to have on board.  BUT we didn't really pitch anyone else or do a competitive auction, so I know we didn't maximize valuation.
