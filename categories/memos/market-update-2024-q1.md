## Venture Market Update - Q1 2024

----

<br/>

It's easiest to make sense of the market if you work backwards from late stage to early.  All numbers in this memo are USD.

<br/>

### Series B/C

* There are a lot of companies out there with 5-10M of revenue, but high burn rates and growing slowly (<2x yoy). Some of them are getting funded, but at low multiples: 8-12x revenue == 50-80M valuation. 

* Very often, these rounds are led by existing investors who are “dollar-cost-averaging” their positions – they originally invested in these companies at sky-high valuations in 2021, and now they are adding ownership at a much lower price so that their average entry price looks better (to LPs).  

* These startups have no choice but to raise now, because the money they raised in 2021 is likely to run out in the next 12 months (at best).

* According to Carta, 23% of the rounds they tracked in Q1 2024 were down rounds -- I'd expect almost all of that to be later-stage rounds.

<br/>

### Series A

* This has a spillover effect on Series A deals.  Investors think: why should I pay 40M pre for a Series A company with 2M revenue, when I can pay 60M pre for a Series B company with 6M revenue? 

* Series A is now the toughest part of the market by far. Last year, the dynamic was that investors wanted to pay no more than a 25x multiple, while founders wanted to get a 40M valuation – and the way to resolve this was that the Series A funding hurdle moved up from 1M to 1.5-2M.  This year, even that's not enough on its own.

* Lots of Series A investors are still taking meetings, going through diligence, etc.  But actual deals remain rare. FOMO is the only real motivator to issue a term sheet.  

* There are three "good places to be" in this market:
	* you're in a hot sector like AI or defense
	* you're growing >5x, and can set up a FOMO auction
	* you're growing >2x and close to breakeven, and can potentially skip the A round completely

<br/>

### Seed

* Seed valuations and activity remain high.  There are a number of factors at play here:

1. Founders don't want to dilute more than 25% at seed stage (and doing so would mess up the cap table for future rounds).  And you need 2-3M (at least!) to clear today's elevated Series A hurdles (esp in SF, NY etc).  So there's an effective floor at 10-12M pre.

2. A lot of companies that raised seed capital a couple of years ago have "hit their target" of 1M arr, only to find that the goalposts have shifted.  So there are more "post-seed" or "seed-plus" rounds happening: companies with 500k-1.2M arr, raising at 20M +/- a bit, but still labelled "seed".  

3. Institutional seed funds are happy to underwrite vision cheques for the former, and traction cheques for the latter.  Some later stage investors are also playing here in a barbell strategy -- seed and Series B/C, but no A in between.

### Other Dynamics

A lot of the funding environment for startups is ultimately a function of the funding environment for VCs ie from their LPs.  

* With the IPO window still closed and no M&A happening, LPs aren't getting liquidity from earlier vintages ie their past investments in venture funds.  A major part of the VC/LP funding market is the recycling of these prior returns.  Without that, VCs can't close new funds, or make new investments.  So there's a temptation among VCs to make their current funds last longer.

* There's an increasing school of thought that the big winners in AI will be public companies -- Microsoft, Meta, nVidia etc.  (with maybe a couple of private companies in there like OpenAI).  So LPs may reconsider their allocation to early-stage venture even if they do have liquidity.

* For this reason I'm skeptical about the invocation of "dry powder" in VC.
