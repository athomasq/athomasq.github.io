## Investor Updates FAQ

----

*At Quandl (the startup I co-founded), we did not send out regular investor updates until after our Series A.  This was a missed opportunity for us; I advise you not to make the same mistake.*

#### Why should I send investor updates?

Good investor updates accomplish two things: they are a management tool for your own benefit, and they help establish your credibility with investors.

The exercise of writing a *good* update every month forces you to understand your business really well.  You'll be forced to identify, track and report your key metrics, and also what's driving them.  Following this over time gives you perspective and also helps with priorities -- what's important, what's just noise, what's working, what's not, etc etc.  (A *bad* update does not accomplish any of these things.  If you find that you're not getting value out of the process of writing your updates, it's probably a sign that your update game needs work.)

Investor updates are also important to establish your credibility with investors. Some of your investors are "passive capital" -- they've written a cheque, and that's that -- you don't expect them to help much in the future.  But ideally at least some and hopefully all of your investors are people who can help you at some point -- with strategic or tactical advice, or with intros to follow-on investors, or with further investment themselves.  So it's worth spending some effort to keep them in the loop and happy and excited about your company's progress.  The quality of help they can give you is directly correlated with the quality of updates you give them.


#### How often should I send out investor updates?

Once a month, shortly after the beginning of the month.  Quarterly is too infrequent (startups change faster than that) and weekly is too frequent (too much of a burden on founders, and you miss the forest for the trees).

The key is to not take too much time writing your updates.  A 3000-word email that arrives on the 20th of the month is not as useful (for either investors or founders) as a brief summary that arrives on the 1st or 5th.  In steady state you should be able to produce and send this email in less than 1 hour of your time.  The ROI of that 1 hour is very high. 


#### How candid should I be in my investor updates?

A common mistake is for founders to treat their investor updates as a continuation of their investor pitch.  When things go wrong -- and in startups, things are always going wrong -- updates written this way become intentionally uninformative or obscure.  

I get it; some amount of pitching is natural and maybe even necessary.  Even with investors, you still want to put your best foot forward.  But if your updates are full of irrelevancies while avoiding actual issues, your investors *will* recognize it, and, more likely than not, think that you're in denial.  

My favourite founder update in recent times began like this: *"Well, that was a pretty crap month."*  That kind of transparency builds a lot of trust.  

The other reason to be candid is simply this: investors want to help --  and they can't help if they're not informed.  If you have to brief them from scratch every time you ask for something, it's ineffecient and leads to low-quality input.  It also precludes "serendipitous" help -- eg. an investor reads your update, and although there's no explicit ask, they reach out because something in there sparks some thoughts that might be relevant.  

The absolute worst option is radio silence.  There's no quicker way to have your investors write you off.  Trust me, as an investor, I'd much rather learn about your challenges and problems and bad news *early*, so that I can try to help you fix them, rather than stay ignorant until it's too late.  


#### What should I include in an investor update?

The essentials are a summary of the business, your latest KPIs, your current set of opportunities and challenges, and your asks of investors.  

Which KPIs?  I like to see:

- business north star (usually, some sort of usage metric)  
- revenue and revenue trend  
- burn and burn trend  
- cash in bank and runway  

In addition to these essentials, you can optionally include functional or team updates, industry updates, strategic musings, whatever else you want.  

Here are two templates for update emails you can use:

- [concise version](/investor-update-template-concise)
- [verbose version](/investor-update-template-verbose)

Btw, don't assume that verbose and detailed is necessarily better -- do whatever fits your own communication style.  


#### What should I NOT include in an investor update?

I sometimes see founders send "marketing updates" -- aimed at their customers -- to their investors.  Don't make this mistake; these are two completely different things.  Same goes for drip campaigns and nurture .

Some founders are hesitant to include revenue and other KPIs in their updates.  Personally, I find that an update without revenue, growth, burn and cash rates is of very limited utility -- it doesn't help me understand the health of the business, and without that understanding, it's hard to offer good, calibrated advice.  So I do advise including them.  But if it makes you feel better, put a disclaimer saying "confidential, please do not share".  

(Ultimately, it comes down to how much you trust your investors.)

I wouldn't include any valuation numbers or fund-raising target numbers in an investor update -- remember, your future investors may (and often do) ask for all your letters as part of their diligence, so be thoughtful about that.  Also, don't include anything that is truly secret sauce.  In any case, most investors won't understand or care about the technical details. 


#### I've never sent updates in the past, and feel awkward about starting now.  What should I do?

Don't overthink it.  Just add a line at the beginning saying: "Although we haven't done so in the past, we'll be sending regular monthly updates from now on.  Here's the first one."  And don't feel obliged to constantly fill in your investors on the last 6 or 12 or 18 months of progress.  Monthly updates should reflect monthly events.  (Maybe in the very first update, you can have a section called "highlights of the last year", but that's about it.)

#### Should I send updates to friends and family investors?

That's a nuanced question.  Sophisticated and experienced investors are fully aware of the challenges that almost all startups go through, and are not fazed by bad news; indeed, they want to hear it early.  But friends and family, who are betting their hard-earned savings on you personally -- I understand that you may not want to spook them.  For them, it may make sense to just send a quarterly or even an annual update, just to keep them in the loop, and not expecting any response or input or help.  This, like much else, is ultimately a judgement call.

#### Are there any exceptions to the above guidelines?

These guidelines are for pre-seed and seed stage companies.  Once you've raised a Series A and have a formal board, all of this becomes obsolete and will be replaced by whatever communication cadence you agree upon with your new investors.  (But many of the habits you develop via these updates will serve you in good stead at that time).

#### Do you think it's worthwhile to add potential investors who aren't in this round to our investor updates? 

(For example, we've been introduced to a few A firms, or Seed & A firms, who have not invested in this round but want to stay updated. Do you think we should add them to investor updates or keep it more personal and just check in every once in a while?)

My instinct is to not add them to the standard monthly investor update, but instead send a more personalized update once every 3-6 months or so, to a selected subset.  

There's a famous blog post by VC Mark Suster saying that investors like to invest in [lines not dots](https://bothsidesofthetable.com/invest-in-lines-not-dots-611f36491d73) -- in other words, they prefer to see progress over a period of time, rather than make a decision based on a one-time snapshot of the company.  (I strongly recommend reading the post).  Well, obviously that makes sense for the investor receiving the updates -- it derisks them and lets them pick and choose the timing of investment -- they can wait for a clear inflection point on traction, plus they are at an advantage (head-start on diligence etc) relative to other investors who see you for the first time when you "officially" start to raise.  Also it costs them nothing to ask for updates, after all you're the one spending time and effort writing, not them.

But it's not clear that this is good for the founder or the startup.  On the one hand, sending regular updates probably does make the future round a bit easier to raise (assuming progress is good!  if you send regular updates about a business that is struggling, then you just make it harder) (conversely, there's nothing as powerful as saying you're going to do something, and then doing it).  On the other hand, it probably hurts your valuation a bit, since it makes the round less competitive -- the best way to get a high valuation is to set up an "auction" (competitive bidding) between different VCs, and if one VC has a head-start, that's hard to do.  In fact some VCs will refuse to even consider investing if they feel that they are "too far behind" in the process.  

That being said, maximizing valuation is not the most important goal for a founder -- I would always advise picking the "right" investor over picking the highest valuation.  (Better to get a reasonable valuation from an investor you trust and who trusts you and who really understands the business, than a high valuation from someone you've just met.)

So my preferred solution is to create a small list of investors who you really like -- who would be your "dream investors" for the next round -- and send them quarterly updates.  Or you can send them suitably redacted versions of the monthly updates if you prefer -- whatever makes sense (and is less work) for you.  But don't send updates to everyone who ever expressed interest -- that's just not efficient use of your time, and there's also a risk of becoming "too exposed" -- everyone wants to feel like they are the only ones with access to the next hot deal, they don't want to be just one of 50 people getting the same carbon copy update.  That's why personalization also helps.

<!--For what it's worth -- our Series B was a pre-emptive round that happened thanks to "lines not dots".  We were introduced to a firm around the time of our Series A -- they were interested but couldn't move fast enough.  But I liked them and they liked me, so I met them next time I was in California, and I spoke to the partner every 6 months or so.  I called him shortly after we launched our marketplace (big step forward for the business) and even though we had lots of cash in the bank and weren't raising, he said -- "I've seen enough, I want to lead your Series B right now" (not in exactly those words, but that was the gist).  So it can totally work!  And he was a great investor to have on board.  BUT we didn't really pitch anyone else or do a competitive auction, so I know we didn't maximize valuation.  -->
