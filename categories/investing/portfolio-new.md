### Portfolio Notes

🌱 All the above investments were done at what would today (2023) be considered pre-seed stage: very early product with minimal or zero revenue.

<!--🧭 I invest only where I think I have an edge, in either dealflow or evaluation.  As a consequence, my portfolio tends to skew non-Bay Area, mostly B2B, and mostly under-represented or atypical founder profiles.-->

<!--🎯 I invest my own money.  This gives me a very different objective function from many (most?) startup investors.-->

😎 My portfolio companies have gone on to raise further funding from Sequoia, Tiger Global, Falcon Edge, GIC and others.
