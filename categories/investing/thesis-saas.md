### Overview

Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) has been one of the most powerful business models of the last decade plus, for both founders and investors.  SaaS companies have inherent advantages:

* Easy to build and launch an MVP, and improve it over time
* Easy to sell focused point solutions to solve specific customer needs
* Easy to deploy and to onboard customers
* Compatible with multiple GTM motions: 
* Freemium, self-serve, product-led growth, inside sales, enterprise sales
* Recurring revenue, often paid upfront, offers strong growth economics

However, the very attributes that make building and selling SaaS **easy in the short run**, make these companies **vulnerable in the long run**. It is precisely this ease of growth that implies there are **no strong barriers to entry in SaaS**; no defensibility beyond first-mover advantage and customer inertia.  The more successful a SaaS business appears, the more likely it is that competitors will emerge, and potentially grow just as fast.

As a result, many mature SaaS companies tend to see their **profit margins competed away**: either through rising customer acquisition costs, or through price competition among vendors.  A significant number of SaaS companies are unprofitable and indeed have never been profitable.  Instead, companies raise larger and larger financing rounds, spend it all on sales and marketing, and never achieve breakeven.

While this hasn’t prevented previous generations of investors from making large returns on their SaaS investments, the venture market has changed. Today, growth alone – and growth was always the strongest facet of the typical SaaS unicorn – is insufficient; the market demands sustainable, profitable, efficient growth.  I hypothesize that the best way to deliver such “healthy” growth is through structurally defensible SaaS.

Specifically, my thesis is that SaaS companies with clear and sustainable sources of defensibility outside the core SaaS component, tend to win.  Competitors cannot displace them merely by replicating their software; customers will not churn just for a better deal elsewhere.  As a result, defensible SaaS companies have lower attrition rates, more pricing power, and lower acquisition costs: all of which result in dramatically better long-run, at-scale economics.

### Types of Defensibility

I'm aware of a few different types of structural defensibility in SaaS:

#### 1. System-of-record effect
Some SaaS solutions act as the “system of record” or “single source of truth” for critical enterprise information: sales & marketing data, or employee data, or engineering data.  It’s usually very hard to migrate that data to a new vendor or platform, and so these solutions tend to be sticky and defensible. 

#### 2. Workflow integration
SaaS solutions that are tightly integrated into enterprise workflows are hard to disrupt, for multiple reasons: switching costs, user familiarity, organizational inertia, and risk aversion.

#### 3. Surface area
Solutions with a large “surface area” – that is, solutions that are used by multiple users and roles across the enterprise, or solutions that bridge different functional areas, or solutions that do a lot of different things for the user, are hard to displace piecemeal. 

#### 4. True technological innovation
Most software solutions are easy to replicate, but some are not.  Companies whose product involves genuine technical innovation gain defensibility from that innovation.

#### 5. Non-software component
SaaS companies that incorporate a non-software component – hardware sensors, say, or physical logistics – are hard to replicate; there’s an associated cost, expertise, and barrier to entry for competitors. 


#### 6. Network effects
Network effects are well understood, albeit usually in the context of marketplace, social network, or platform businesses.  But examples also exist in SaaS:

* **Learning loop:** the SaaS gets smarter and better, with more users and data 
* **Users:** customers benefit from the presence of other customers
* **Marketplace / ecosystem:** app store and integrations on top of the basic SaaS
* **Standards:** define a file format or protocol that everyone has to use (e.g. XLS)

Each of these network effects make it harder for customers to stop using the SaaS product.  Note however that many of these only kick in at scale.	

#### 7. User experience
Some SaaS companies retain customers because they have a genuine edge in user experience or capability that competitors simply cannot replicate.  Usually this stems from deep domain expertise, which allows these companies to continually stay one step ahead of the competition.  (Brand is an essential component of this type of defensibility.)

### Pros and Cons

Of these, I believe / suspect that #1-4 are the most important and investable sources of defensibility: system-of-record, workflow integration, surface area and technological innovation. #5-7 are somewhat more challenging: hardware can be costly, network effects only kick in at scale, edges based on user experience are rare.  

I'm actively looking to invest in SaaS companies that exhibit one or more (preferably two or three) of these sources of defensibility.  This is also why I care about net retention: it’s a strong proxy for both product-market-fit and true (actual) defensibility.

Finally, it goes without saying that believe that the best defensibility comes from **investing in exceptional founders**.  At the pre-seed stage where I typically invest, every aspect of the company, from product to market to distribution, is fluid and evolving – but exceptional founders find a way to build sustainable, healthy, defensible businesses.  My guidelines on defensible SaaS are not just a set of filter criteria; they are also a vision exercise and execution template for what a particular startup could become, under the right leadership.

###  Risks and Challenges

#### 1. Rarity
Truly defensible SaaS businesses are rare.  I'm a picky investor, and this means higher hurdles and a lower frequency of investment.

#### 2. Time and expense to build
Defensible SaaS models tend to be comparatively more expensive to build, because there’s more to them than just the basic SaaS: a system of record, or technological innovation, or large surface area.  This necessitates more upfront investment, but also acts as a barrier to entry for competitors or copycats in and of itself.

#### 3. Scale requirements
Many sources of defensibility only kick in at scale: especially network effects (marketplace, learning loop, community-based) and surface-area effects.  This is good for long-term performance – unlike ‘vanilla’ SaaS where economics degrades over time, true defensible SaaS improves over time – but it does make for slow going initially.
