## User Manual

----

If you're reading this page, it means I've invested in your company. Thank you for the privilege!  I'm excited to be part of your journey.

This page is a "user manual" for getting the most out of me as an investor. It's a collection of patterns and practices that have worked well in the past. Feel free to suggest improvements!

   **Overall Philosophy**

1. I try to be an active and engaged investor, adding value beyond just my investment dollars. I genuinely want to help, and am willing to devote time and effort on your behalf.

2. I have a low ego about it. I help if I can, and stay out of the way if I can't.

3. After I've invested, you don't have to pitch me or sell me any more -- I'm already on your side.

4. I don't ever want to add negative value. If I ever waste your time or give you faulty, useless or irrelevant advice, please tell me bluntly, and I will course correct. I have a thick skin, I can take it.

5. You don't have to flatter me or worry about hurting my feelings. That said, I'm only human; consideration is always appreciated.

    **Communication Channels**  

6. Email is my preferred async channel. I'm trying to move all my "work" email to **at@abrahamthomas.info** -- if you previously corresponded with athos1@gmail.com, please switch.

7. I read emails daily and indeed hourly, but may take 2-3 days to respond. If it's time-sensitive, don't hesitate to send me a nudge -- I don't mind.  

8. If you want a quick, short turnaround, text me or whatsapp me. Those channels are noisier and stuff slips through the cracks all the time, so again, don't hesitate to send me a nudge. 

9. Zoom (or equivalent) is good for open-ended conversation, but it can be fatiguing. Phone calls work just as well.

10. Sometimes I like to record Loom videos when I don't have the time to write a detailed email. 

11. I travel a fair bit, and I don't always set out-of-office replies. If it's important, put URGENT or ACTION NEEDED in the subject line. Don't abuse this option :)

    **Types of Help**  

12. The vast majority of help I provide is in the form of advice. Here's what my portfolio founders have to say [about this](https://abrahamthomas.info/testimonials/).

13. I am always willing to offer suggestions, share experiences or observations, collaborate on problems or strategy, and act as a sounding board or sanity check. 

14. I cannot make decisions for you, and I don't want to. Instead, I try to share frameworks for thinking through any given problem or situation. 

15. If my input is relevant, great; if it's not, please feel free to ignore it -- I don't mind. 

16. As a founder, I was a true generalist, and there is almost no category of problem that's out of scope for me. If in doubt, ask!

17. I think I'm especially strong on financial strategy (budget, burn, growth, board service), on marketing (all aspects -- demand-gen, brand, positioning, seo, pr), on company-building (culture, recruiting, handling tricky situations), and on fund-raising (pitch design, VC outreach, planning a campaign). 

18. I've angel-invested in 30+ companies and I'm an LP in multiple VC funds, so I have a pretty good view of early stage tech. I'm happy to share benchmarks and anecdata across my portfolio.

19. I write occasional [memos for portfolio founders](https://abrahamthomas.info/memos/).  I also have a number of spreadsheet templates for financial planning, sales modelling, growth analytics etc, which I'm happy to share.

20. Here are some other [ways I can help](https://abrahamthomas.info/why-me/).

    **Cadence and Scheduling**

21. Some founders like to have regular scheduled calls me; others like to invoke my help "on-demand". I am fine with either of these options -- whatever works best for you. (And some founders don't want or need my help -- that's cool too.)

22. I find that for pre-scheduled calls, 1 hour every 6 (+/-2) weeks works well. For on-demand calls, the typical pattern is that a founder goes 3-6 months without needing any input, and then something comes up and we have multiple calls and interactions over a short period of time. Again, whatever works best for you.

23. Please send calendar invites with meeting links for all conversations. 

    **Investor Updates**

24. I strongly recommend that you send out monthly investor updates -- it's the one thing I ask for as an investor. It's hard for me to help you if I don't know what's going on.  More [here](/writing-investor-updates). 

25. Quite apart from my help and input, writing investor updates helps you zoom out on the business, and it builds confidence across your investor network for future fund-raising conversations. 

     **Fund-Raising and Syndicates**

26. Although I write small cheques, I do like to participate across multiple rounds of financing, and appreciate being given the opportunity to do so.

27. I have a network of fellow angel investors and I manage a small syndicate. If you're raising capital and if I think your company will be a good fit for my syndicate, I may be able to mobilize some extra money for you. Let me know if this option ever makes sense.

28. I think I'm exceptionally good at helping companies "tell their story", so if you're getting ready to raise a round, let me know, and we can craft your pitch together.

29. I have a number of VC connections in Canada and the USA, and can make introductions when appropriate.  I'm also very experienced at navigating the fund-raising process, both for Quandl (raised 20M) and for a number of my portfolio companies, and can be your consigliere through it all.

    **Emotional Support**

30. Being a founder is incredibly hard. One of the best ways I add value is by offering an empathetic view from somebody who has been there and done that.

31. You can be vulnerable with me, ask for help, share your worries -- I won't judge you, blame you, criticize you, discourage you, or write you off. I will try to help. I'm on your side.

32. Fundamentally, I believe you are the best person(s) to run the company; that's why I invested. My job is to support you and be steady: keep you grounded when you're euphoric, and lift you up when you're feeling down.

    **References and Introductions**

33. I don't want to spam you with unwanted intros, but am happy to connect you with my other [portfolio founders](https://abrahamthomas.info/portfolio-companies/) if you'd like; let me know.

34. I'd like to expand my network of angels and VCs, and I may ask you for intros to your other investors, if you're okay with that.

35. My reputation is my best (and only) currency as a small angel investor. I deeply appreciate any positive references or introductions you provide. A testimonial, like, tweet or Linked-In post goes a long way!

36. I'm always keen to meet talented founders building exciting companies. If you meet or know of other pre-seed or seed stage founders who are raising money, please send them my way!
