## Investing in Public

----

*In the spirit of "building in public", I'll share occasional updates on my angel portfolio here.*

---

<br/>

### Overview

As of December 2024, I've angel invested in **37 companies**, and my investments have a **blended IRR of 24%**.  

11 companies have had definite outcomes: 1 substantial exit at 40x, 1 okay exit at 6x, 3 exits that each returned ~1x, and 6 failures.  

26 companies are "live".  Of these, there are 5 companies that I'm confident will each return at least 10x; there are 6 others that I am pessimistic about; and the jury is out on the remaining 15.

### Cohorts

My angel investing career has had several distinct phases.  Combining them into a single portfolio isn't as informative as breaking them into cohorts:

**Cohort I:** 2014-2017, 9 companies, India focus  
**Cohort II:** 2019-2021, 14 companies, generalist  
**Cohort III:** 2022-2024, 14 companies, thesis-driven  

These cohorts analogize nicely to "traditional" venture fund cycles; they also reflect my evolving investment strategy.  Details below.

<br/>


### Cohort I: 2014 to 2017 (India)

I made my first arms-length angel investment in 2014, while running my own startup Quandl.  Over the next 3 years I invested in 8 more companies.  These were all small cheques into India-based startups, about half direct and half via syndicate.  I didn't follow any systematic strategy for selection or portfolio construction; this was a very *ad hoc* portfolio.  

* Companies: **9**  
* Cheques: **14**  
* MOIC: **5.2**  
* DPI: **4.1**  
* IRR: **31%**  

**Key learnings:** power law outcomes; pay attention to deal mechanics; DPI is more important than MOIC or IRR; avoid uncompensated risk (eg FX).

### Cohort II: 2019 to 2021 (global)

Between 2019 and 2021 I wrote 24 cheques into 14 companies, while running Quandl post its acquisition by Nasdaq.  These were slightly larger cheques, but with a different geographical focus than cohort I: Canada, the US and Europe.  These investments were somewhat *ad hoc* initially, but got more intentional towards the end.

* Companies: **14**  
* Cheques: **24**  
* MOIC: **2.0**  
* DPI: **0.1**  
* IRR: **24%**  

**Key learnings:** entry price matters; avoid both fomo and value investing; consensus decisions lead to mediocre outcomes.

<br/>

### Cohort III: 2022 to 2024 (global)

Starting in 2022, I became more intentional about angel investing; this coincided with my moving on from Quandl and Nasdaq.  I now have a tighter thesis, portfolio model, and dealflow channels.  

* Companies: **14**  
* Cheques: **16**  
* MOIC: **1.1**  
* DPI: **0.0**  
* IRR: **4%**  

**Key learnings:** differentiation matters; tech beats hype; reason from first principles; trust your judgement; don't sweat the J-curve.

### Revenue Growth

I like to invest in companies with capital-efficient growth and sound unit economics.  Such companies don't need a lot of follow-on investment; ironically, this means fewer markups and lower "paper" valuations.

In the absence of markups, I sometimes use revenue as a proxy for value creation. Here are some revenue stats for cohorts II and III:

Annual revenue (USD), entry versus today:
* Average: **$120k &rarr; $1.1M**  
* Median: **$0k &rarr; $500k**  
* Max: **$600k &rarr; $7M** *(not the same company)*    

Companies with more than $1M in ARR: **7 out of 28**.    
(I'm hopeful / confident that 4 more will join the club in 2025.)

### Breakdowns

Here are some other ways to break down my portfolio:

* Geography: 14 Canada, 14 global
* Work style: 18 in-person, 10 remote
* Stage: 15 pre-seed, 13 seed 
* Sector: 9 MAD stack, 3 infrastructure, 5 fintech, 4 SaaS, 7 other
* Profile: 36 of 51 founders are "outsiders" (18 of 28 CEOs)

### End notes

I invest my own money, and I also lead a small [syndicate](https://venture.angellist.com/abraham-thomas/syndicate) that coinvests with me.  The above figures are all for my personal angel portfolio.

Company marks are based on the latest priced round.  I proactively mark down companies where I don't think prices reflect true valuations; often, all the way to zero.

This is the update for 2024.  You can also read older updates: for [2023](/portfolio-statistics-2023) and [2022](/portfolio-statistics-2022).  

None of this is investment advice, nor is it an offer or solicitation to buy or sell securities or anything else.

### By Investment Year

Now that I have a decade of historical data, I thought I'd share some yearly performance stats:

|year|y/y portfolio return|vintage IRR|
|----|--------------------|-----------|
|2014|  n.a.| 11.5%|
|2015|  0.0%| 53.9%|
|2016| 60.5%| 24.4%|
|2017|  3.9%| 12.8%|
|2018| -9.7%| 15.6%|
|2019|124.0%| 37.7%|
|2020|  7.2%| 37.2%|
|2021| 85.1%| -9.1%|
|2022| -9.9%| 11.5%|
|2023|  5.2%|-16.4%|
|2024| 36.1%|  0.0%|


The year-over-year portfolio return (column 2) is the annual change in value of all my angel investments, not counting new investments or exits.  As expected, this oscillates between slightly down years (due to writeoffs)(the j-curve at work), and big up years (due to markups) (the power law at work).  Regressing this series against the S&P 500 gives a beta of 1.8 (to be expected) and an annual alpha of 5.8% (yay!).

This is not, in fact, how most venture investors mark their books; instead, they typically use vintage IRRs (column 3).  For each year, this is the (to-date) IRR of all investments made during that year.  This one's much more consistent, albeit not investable or compoundable in any sense.
