* The accidental trader
* Why I quit my hedge fund job
* The data revolution in finance


I've been on "both sides of the table" in both public and private markets.

In public markets, I was a portfolio manager at Simplex, a large hedge fund; I then co-founded Quandl, a data startup whose customers are hedge funds and fintechs.

In private markets, I raised $20M in venture capital for Quandl prior to our successful acquisition by Nasdaq; I also invest in and mentor other founders as an angel.


I like to think these experiences give me useful perspective on multiple intersecting worlds: capital markets, technology and entrepreneurship.
