## What I Invest In

----

<br/> 

### Criteria

Here are my portfolio guidelines:

🌱 I invest at **pre-seed and seed stage**. I may follow on *pro rata* in Series A or B rounds, but I rarely write first cheques at those stages.

📡 I like **B2B companies**, including vertical and horizontal software, B2B marketplaces, data and API businesses, platforms & infrastructure, systems of record, unglamorous plumbing, AI/ML tools, and anything involving network effects.  

🛍 I generally **steer clear of consumer businesses**, D2C ecommerce, edtech, healthcare, productivity, gaming, RE, silicon, security and crypto.  You're welcome to pitch me if your startup falls in those categories, but I'm very unlikely to invest.

⚛️ I'm building competence in energy, space, bio, and other **deeptech**, especially where mediated by software and data.  I welcome pitches in those areas, even though I may not be ready to invest.

🚀 I like to see genuine **technological or business model innovation**.  Solving hard problems is a valuable moat.

*All these criteria are flexible for the right team in the right market with the right approach.  If in doubt, [pitch me](/pitch-me)!*

### Philosophy

Here is my selection philosophy:

🔮 At the highest level, I invest in startups that are building **a future I want to be part of**, and I try to help them make that future a reality. Beyond that, there are no rules.

🔥 **Team ability and macro trends** matter the most to me. Big ideas, market pull and innovative tech are also important. Traction is useful as a proxy for these attributes. Validation is priceless.

🌎 I'm **flexible on geography, industry, and business model**. I prefer B2B to consumer. About half my portfolio is in Canada, and half outside it.

🐶 I like both overdogs with **unfair advantages**, and underdogs who are **scrappy, resilient, resourceful**. I invest in both 'brave new world" startups and 'faster better cheaper' startups. 

👥 I don't really care about who else is investing. I welcome **unusual ideas** and atypical founder profiles. 

❤️ Building a startup is hard. I seek **founders of character**: resourceful, resilient, optimistic, curious, competitive, and committed.  If this is you, please [reach out](/mailto:athos1@gmail.com)!
