## What I Invest In

----

<br/> 

### Criteria

* I invest at pre-seed and seed stage. I may follow on *pro rata* in Series A or B rounds, but I rarely write first cheques at those stages.

* I like SaaS, b2b marketplaces, platforms, data and API businesses, platforms & infrastructure, systems of record, unglamorous plumbing, and anything involving network effects.  

* I generally steer clear of consumer businesses, d2c and ecommerce, edtech, healthcare, RE and crypto.  You're welcome to pitch me if your startup falls in those categories, but my probability of investment is low.

* I like to see genuine technological or business model innovation.  Solving hard problems is a valuable moat.

All these criteria are flexible for the right team in the right market with the right product.



### Philosophy

🔮 At the highest level, I invest in startups that are building a future I want to be part of, and I try to help them make that future a reality. Beyond that, there are no rules.

🔥 Team ability and macro trends matter the most to me. Big ideas and innovative tech are also important. Traction is useful as a proxy for these attributes. 

🌎 I'm flexible on geography, industry, and business model. I prefer B2B to consumer. About half my portfolio is in Canada, and half outside it.

🐶 I like both overdogs with "unfair advantages", and underdogs who are "scrappy, resilient, resourceful". I invest in both "brave new world" startups and "faster better cheaper" startups.
