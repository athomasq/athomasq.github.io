## Co-invest With Me

----

<br/>


Consensus decisions lead to mediocre outcomes.  For this reason, I prefer investing in startups that are unappreciated by the market, in the expectation that the market will eventually come to appreciate them.  

This means that I typically invest in rounds that are undersubscribed.  This in turn means that I'm happy to share dealflow with co-investors.

If you'd like to co-invest with me, please [reach out](mailto:athos1@gmail.com).
