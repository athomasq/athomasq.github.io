## Co-Invest With Me

----

<br/>

I welcome your dealflow, and I'm happy to share mine.  If you'd like to co-invest with me, please reach out: at@abrahamthomas.info.  

Consensus decisions lead to mediocre outcomes.  For this reason, I prefer to invest in startups *before* they are appreciated by the market.  

This means that I typically invest in rounds that are undersubscribed.  This in turn means that I'm happy to share dealflow with co-investors.
