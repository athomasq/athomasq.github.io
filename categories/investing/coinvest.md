## Co-Invest With Me

----

<br/>


Consensus decisions lead to mediocre outcomes.  For this reason, I prefer to invest in startups that are unappreciated by the market; I expect that the market will eventually come to appreciate them.  

This means that I typically invest in rounds that are undersubscribed.  This in turn means that I'm happy to share dealflow with co-investors.

If you'd like to co-invest with me, please [reach out](mailto:at@abrahamthomas.info).
