## Why Work With Me

----

<br/> 

### Being The Best

My goal is to be the best investor on your cap table, period.  

But don't just take my word for it.  Here are some testimonials from my portfolio founders:

* *"Abraham is willing and able to provide advice that can be the tipping point for those difficult founder decisions. The nuance and detail that incorporates your unique business situation, the current market, and his own personal experiences is offered with swift confidence, which is **the ultimate secret weapon** for any founder."*

* *"Abraham is **a great investor to work with**. He's highly professional and always available for help. For anyone looking for capital, Abraham is an excellent addition to have on their cap table"*

* *"Abraham is a true asset. His **wealth of knowledge** on all aspects of growing a business, especially data businesses, combined with his tactical and on-point advice, has been **instrumental in helping us scale** and achieve success. Whether it's raising capital, strengthening the business model, or executing on a growth strategy, Abraham always has valuable insights to share."*

* *"Abraham has been **our most responsive and helpful investor**. He responds thoughtfully to every update, question and ask that we have, and takes the necessary action to make a positive impact on our business."*

* *"When I have a hard problem, **I call Abraham**. He's experienced the same challenges first hand and survived. He truly puts the time and effort to making sure the founders he works with are successful."*

* *"Working with Abraham as an investor has been a journey of **candid, thoughtful strategic advice**. As a founder himself, Abraham empathizes with the ups and downs in running a company.  We turn to him constantly at times of our most difficult decisions and lean on his experience.  He is **always genuine** and spends an outsized amount of time and effort with us."*

* *"A **world class teacher** for go to market, hiring, fundraising and messaging. He's been great at both diving into the details as well as thinking about the long term strategic view. Any B2B founder would benefit greatly from working with him."*

* *"We have been extremely lucky to have found Abraham as an early angel investor in our company. He's been with us from right at the beginning and has consistently provided **absolutely on-point advice** at each stage, in the most hyper rational way which has been a massive assistance against the extreme highs and lows of running an early stage business. I've not only recommended, but actively encouraged other founders to work with Abraham as he brings **so much more than just an investment**."*

### Guiding Principles

I aim to be an investor who founders trust and can rely on.  This means:

* **Support:** I'm a resource for you beyond just my dollars.
* **Expertise:** I'm happy to share any knowledge I have.  
* **Low ego:** I help if I can, and get out of the way if I can't.  
* **High trust:** I act with integrity and professionalism.  
* **Respect for your time:** Quick responses and minimal friction.
* **Alignment:** No zero-sum games; I win when you win.  
* **Empathy:** I've been there, done that -- and I'm on your side.

### Ways I Can Help

My secret sauce is that I spent a decade as the founder of a successful tech startup; but before that I spent another decade as a professional investor at a large hedge fund.  I think this combination is pretty unique, and it lets me help you more effectively.

#### üåé Strategy

My investing experience helps you *strategically*: on resource allocation and business planning; on financing and downstream investors; on competition, moats and ecosystem; on what it takes to win in the long term.  Here are some examples:

* **Resource Allocation:** Balancing growth rates and burn rates, team size and team speed; retaining optionality while seizing opportunity; and ultimately, maximizing your risk-adjusted expected value: resource allocation is central to the CEO's job, and I can help you think systematically and rigorously through it.

* **Financing:** I've raised lots of venture capital, and advised founders who've raised lots more. I can help with: deciding when and why and how much to raise; building a powerful pitch (and the company to support it); executing a disciplined and effective fund-raising process; negotiating terms; and closing the deal.  I can also provide warm intros to many well-known VC firms.

* **Story-Telling:** The ability to craft a compelling narrative -- for customers, for partners, for investors, for employees, for the press -- is an essential part of the founder's toolkit, and it's something I have a lot of experience with.  Category creation is an especial strength.

* **Recruiting and Culture:** The team you build is the company you build. To attract and retain and empower and scale a truly world-class team is perhaps the biggest challenge for founders today. Creating a strong, sustainable, high-performance, happy culture is the key to solving this challenge, and it's something I pride myself on.

* **Macro:** Businesses are not built in a vacuum. Successful founders need to understand the macro environment; economic cycles and the cost of capital; business model evolution; customer, partner and investor dynamics; and more -- and this is truer than ever in 2023. 

#### üéØ Tactics

My founder experience helps you *tactically*: on go-to-market, on positioning and story-telling; on data and API strategy; on culture and recruiting; and perhaps most important, with alignment and empathy.  I've worn lots of different hats as a founder; as a result I can help on almost all operational aspects of early-stage startups.  Here are some examples:

* **Go-To-Market:** A great product won't change the world unless it's matched with great distribution. And modern distribution is complex: inbound, outbound, bottom-up, top-down, pincer, product-driven, sales-driven, community-driven, channel-driven, hybrid -- there are so many interacting options. I can help you navigate them.

* **Data and API Strategy**: I know the modern data ecosystem well, and can help on almost every aspect of data in your organization: business and commercial strategy, infrastructure and technical choices, benefits and limitations of data, building effective data teams, and more.

* **Network Effects:** Network effects businesses are hard to start, but extremely powerful at scale.  As the founder of a saas-enabled marketplace with multiple overlapping network effects, I have a lot of insight into the nuances of building and scaling such businesses.

<!--ü§ù **Resources and community:** I write regular memos for my portfolio founders, covering important market and macro trends, tactical and strategic tips, functional resources, and more; they tend to be more concrete and actionable than most "startup advice".  My founders also form a supportive and friendly community that I foster.-->

* **Empathy ‚ù§Ô∏è:** Being a founder is hard. As a founder who has been through the venture-backed journey myself, from inception to exit, I believe I can be more aligned, more insightful, and more empathetic about the challenges you face than most investors without that experience.
