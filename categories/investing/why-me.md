## Why Work With Me

----

<br/> 


### Guiding Principles

I aim to be an investor who founders trust and can rely on.  This means:

* **Support:** I'm a resource for you beyond just my dollars.
* **Expertise:** I'm happy to share any knowledge I have.  
* **Low ego:** I help if I can, and get out of the way if I can't.  
* **High trust:** I act with integrity and professionalism.  
* **Respect for your time:** Quick responses, minimal friction.
* **No games:** I win when you win.

### Why Work With Me?

‚ù§Ô∏è **Empathy:** Being a founder is hard. As a founder who has been through the venture-backed journey myself, from inception to exit, I believe I can be more aligned, more insightful, and more empathetic about the challenges you face than most investors without that experience.

üîß **Execution:** I can help tactically on almost all operational aspects of early-stage startups: product & engineering; sales & marketing; culture & team-building; go-to-market strategy; narrative creation & positioning; and fund-raising.

üß† **Knowledge:** There are a few topics that I have specific deep expertise in: data & API business models; data science & data engineering; capital markets & B2B fintech; starting & scaling network-effects businesses; and building successful data-centric organizations.

ü§ù **Networks:** I can help with introductions and references for potential customers, partners, job candidates, expert operators, and down-stream investors including many well-known VC firms.
