## Why Work With Me

----

<br/> 

### Being The Best

My goal is to be the best investor on your cap table.  I don't write large cheques, but I strive to offer the highest value relative to dollars invested.

But don't take my word for it.  Here are some testimonials from my portfolio founders:

* *"asdf asdf asdf"*
* *"jkl; jkl; jkl;"*
* *"qwer qwer qwer"*

### Guiding Principles

I aim to be an investor who founders trust and can rely on, absolutely.  This means:

* **Support:** I'm a resource for you beyond just my dollars.
* **Expertise:** I'm happy to share any knowledge I have.  
* **Low ego:** I help if I can, and get out of the way if I can't.  
* **High trust:** I act with integrity and professionalism.  
* **Respect for your time:** Quick responses and minimal friction.
* **Alignment:** No zero-sum games; I win when you win.  
* **Empathy:** I've been there, done that -- and I'm on your side.

### Ways I Can Help

I've worn lots of different hats as a founder; as a result I can help on almost all operational aspects of early-stage startups. I’m especially strong on:  

🧩 **Strategy:** Balancing growth rates and burn rates, team size and team speed; positioning for customers and investors; retaining optionality while seizing opportunity; and ultimately, maximizing your risk-adjusted expected value: these tasks are more important than ever in the current (2023) market environment.  

💸 **Financing:** I've raised lots of venture capital, and advised founders who've raised lots more. I can help with: deciding when and why and how much to raise; building a powerful pitch (and the company to support it); executing a disciplined and effective fund-raising process; negotiating terms; and closing the deal.  I can also provide warm intros to many well-known VC firms.

🌻 **Go-to-market:** A great product won't change the world unless it's matched with great distribution. And modern distribution is complex: inbound, outbound, bottom-up, top-down, pincer, product-driven, sales-driven, community-driven, channel-driven, hybrid -- there are so many interacting options. I can help you navigate them.

📝 **Story-telling:** The ability to craft a compelling narrative -- for customers, for partners, for investors, for employees, for the press -- is an essential part of the founder's toolkit, and it's something I have a lot of experience with.  Category creation is an especial strength.

💽 **Data and API strategy**: I know the modern data ecosystem well, and can help on almost every aspect of data in your organization: business and commercial strategy, infrastructure and technical choices, benefits and limitations of data, building effective data teams, and more.

👩‍💻 **Recruiting and culture:** The team you build is the company you build. To attract and retain and empower and scale a truly world-class team is perhaps the biggest challenge for founders today. Creating a strong, sustainable, high-performance, happy culture is the key to solving this challenge, and it's something I pride myself on.

🌐 **Network effects:** Network effects businesses are hard to start, but extremely powerful at scale.  As the founder of a saas-enabled marketplace with multiple overlapping network effects, I have a lot of insight into the nuances of building and scaling such businesses.

<!--🤝 **Resources and community:** I write regular memos for my portfolio founders, covering important market and macro trends, tactical and strategic advice, functional tips, and more.  My founders also form a supportive and friendly community that I foster.-->

❤️ **Empathy:** Being a founder is hard. As a founder who has been through the venture-backed journey myself, from inception to exit, I believe I can be more aligned, more insightful, and more empathetic about the challenges you face than most investors without that experience.
