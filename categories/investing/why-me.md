## Why Work With Me

----

<br/> 

### Guiding Principles

I aim to be an investor who founders trust and can rely on.  This means:

* **Support:** I'm a resource for you beyond just my dollars.
* **Expertise:** I'm happy to share any knowledge I have.  
* **Low ego:** I help if I can, and get out of the way if I can't.  
* **High trust:** I act with integrity and professionalism.  
* **Respect for your time:** Quick responses, minimal friction.
* **No games:** I win when you win.

### Why Work With Me?

🤝 **Networks:** I can help with introductions and references for potential customers, partners, job candidates, expert operators, and down-stream investors including many well-known VC firms.

🧠 **Knowledge:** There are a few topics that I have specific deep expertise in: data & API business models; data science & data engineering; capital markets & B2B fintech; starting & scaling network-effects businesses; and building successful data-centric organizations.

🔧 **Execution:** I can help tactically on almost all operational aspects of early-stage startups: product & engineering; sales & marketing; culture & team-building; go-to-market strategy; narrative creation & positioning; and fund-raising.

❤️ **Empathy:** Being a founder is hard. As a founder who has been through the venture-backed journey myself, from inception to exit, I believe I can be more aligned, more insightful, and more empathetic about the challenges you face than most investors without that experience.

### How I Help


I can help on almost all operational aspects of early-stage startups. I’m especially strong on:  

🧩 **Strategy:** Balancing growth rates and burn rates, team size and team speed; positioning for customers and investors; retaining optionality while seizing opportunity; and ultimately, maximizing your risk-adjusted expected value: these tasks are more important than ever in the current (2023) market environment.  

💸 **Financing:** I've raised lots of venture capital, and advised founders who've raised lots more. I think I'm good at it: deciding when and why and how much to raise; building a compelling pitch (and the company to support it); executing a disciplined and effective fund-raising process, with lots of tactical touches; negotiating terms and closing the deal.

🌻 **Go-to-market:** A great product won't change the world unless it's matched with great distribution. And modern distribution is complex: inbound, outbound, bottom-up, top-down, product-driven, sales-driven, community-driven, channel-driven, hybrid -- there are so many interacting options. I can help you navigate them.

📝 **Story-telling:** The ability to craft a compelling narrative -- for customers, for partners, for investors, for employees, for the press -- is an essential part of the founder's toolkit, and it's something I have a lot of experience with.

💽 **Data and API strategy**: I know the modern data ecosystem well, and can help on almost every aspect of data in your organization: business and commercial strategy, infrastructure and technical choices, and team construction and growth. 

👩‍💻 **Recruiting and culture:** The team you build is the company you build. To attract and retain and empower and scale a truly world-class team is perhaps the biggest challenge for founders today. Creating a strong culture is the key to solving this challenge, and it's something I pride myself on.
