## Why Work With Me

----

<br/> 

### Being The Best

My goal is to be the best investor on your cap table.  I don't write large cheques, but I strive to offer the most value.

But don't just take my word for it.  Here are some testimonials from my portfolio founders:

* *"Abraham is willing and able to provide advice that can be the tipping point for those difficult founder decisions. The nuance and detail that incorporates your unique business situation, the current market, and his own personal experiences is offered with swift confidence, which is the ultimate secret weapon for any founder."*

* *"Abraham is a great angel investor to work with. He's highly professional and always available for help. For anyone looking for capital, Abraham is an excellent addition to have on their cap table"*

* *"Abraham has been our most responsive and helpful investor. He responds thoughtfully to every update, question and ask that we have, and takes the necessary action to make a positive impact on our business."*

* *"We have been extremely lucky to have found Abraham as an early angel investor in our company. He's been with us from right at the beginning and has consistently provided absolutely on-point advice at each stage, in the most hyper rational way which has been a massive assistance against the extreme highs and lows of running an early stage business. I've not only recommended, but actively encouraged other founders to work with Abraham as he brings so much more than just an investment."*"

### Guiding Principles

I aim to be an investor who founders trust and can rely on.  This means:

* **Support:** I'm a resource for you beyond just my dollars.
* **Expertise:** I'm happy to share any knowledge I have.  
* **Low ego:** I help if I can, and get out of the way if I can't.  
* **High trust:** I act with integrity and professionalism.  
* **Respect for your time:** Quick responses and minimal friction.
* **Alignment:** No zero-sum games; I win when you win.  
* **Empathy:** I've been there, done that -- and I'm on your side.

### Ways I Can Help

I've worn lots of different hats as a founder; as a result I can help on almost all operational aspects of early-stage startups. I‚Äôm especially strong on:  

üß© **Strategy:** Balancing growth rates and burn rates, team size and team speed; positioning for customers and investors; retaining optionality while seizing opportunity; and ultimately, maximizing your risk-adjusted expected value: these tasks are more important than ever in the current (2023) market environment.  

üí∏ **Financing:** I've raised lots of venture capital, and advised founders who've raised lots more. I can help with: deciding when and why and how much to raise; building a powerful pitch (and the company to support it); executing a disciplined and effective fund-raising process; negotiating terms; and closing the deal.  I can also provide warm intros to many well-known VC firms.

üåª **Go-to-market:** A great product won't change the world unless it's matched with great distribution. And modern distribution is complex: inbound, outbound, bottom-up, top-down, pincer, product-driven, sales-driven, community-driven, channel-driven, hybrid -- there are so many interacting options. I can help you navigate them.

üìù **Story-telling:** The ability to craft a compelling narrative -- for customers, for partners, for investors, for employees, for the press -- is an essential part of the founder's toolkit, and it's something I have a lot of experience with.  Category creation is an especial strength.

üíΩ **Data and API strategy**: I know the modern data ecosystem well, and can help on almost every aspect of data in your organization: business and commercial strategy, infrastructure and technical choices, benefits and limitations of data, building effective data teams, and more.

üë©‚Äçüíª **Recruiting and culture:** The team you build is the company you build. To attract and retain and empower and scale a truly world-class team is perhaps the biggest challenge for founders today. Creating a strong, sustainable, high-performance, happy culture is the key to solving this challenge, and it's something I pride myself on.

üåê **Network effects:** Network effects businesses are hard to start, but extremely powerful at scale.  As the founder of a saas-enabled marketplace with multiple overlapping network effects, I have a lot of insight into the nuances of building and scaling such businesses.

<!--ü§ù **Resources and community:** I write regular memos for my portfolio founders, covering important market and macro trends, tactical and strategic tips, functional resources, and more; they tend to be more concrete and actionable than most "startup advice".  My founders also form a supportive and friendly community that I foster.-->

‚ù§Ô∏è **Empathy:** Being a founder is hard. As a founder who has been through the venture-backed journey myself, from inception to exit, I believe I can be more aligned, more insightful, and more empathetic about the challenges you face than most investors without that experience.
