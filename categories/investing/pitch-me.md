## How To Pitch Me

----

<br/> 

### Mechanics

*I suggest following these guidelines to minimize wasted time and maximize our chances of a productive conversation:*

<br/>

📧 The best way to contact me is by **email: athos1@gmail.com** 

🧊 I welcome cold emails!  **No need for a warm intro**.

📞 Don't send me text, linked-in, whatsapp or twitter DMs; **I may not respond**. (And if I do, it will only be to ask that you move the conversation over to email.)

📝 Send me a brief message along with a **deck or memo**.  No need to ask permission to send a deck.  

ℹ️ Your message should include the following **baseline info**: what the company does; founder background(s); company stage and traction; how much you're raising; and at what valuation.

❗️ Without this info, I will either ignore your email, or respond asking you to fill in the blanks, so please **save time for both of us** by including this info from the start.

💡 If you have a **secret or special insight** into your market, unique expertise, or intriguing early signals of market pull / product validation, please mention them!

🤐 **I don't sign NDAs**, so please don't ask.

🙇‍♂️ **I treat founders with respect**, and I ask that you reciprocate.

### Timelines

*I try to reach investment decisions using no more than 2 meetings and 2 weeks of calendar time:*

<br/>

1️⃣ You **email me your deck**, including the baseline info specified above.

2️⃣ I pass, or I send you **3-5 preliminary questions** to gauge if this is a fit.  The goal is to avoid wasting time for either of us.

3️⃣ We do an **intro meeting**, in which you describe the vision, product, market, company, team, traction, tech, and macro trends (why now?).  

4️⃣ I pass, or I send you **10-12 deep-dive questions** that examine the business more closely.

5️⃣ We do a **deep-dive meeting** during which you answer these questions.  (Or you can answer them by email if you prefer).

6️⃣ I pass, or I commit to invest, and you accept using the [YC handshake](https://www.ycombinator.com/handshake/).

7️⃣ You send me the **investment docs and wire instructions**; I sign them and wire the funds.

<br/>

*Despite my best efforts, sometimes things slip; if I seem to drop the ball, please send me a nudge.  Also, please send calendar invites with links or locations for all meetings.*

### Passing

☹️ I invest in fewer than 1% of the companies I see, so please don't take it personally if your company isn't for me.

📝 I try to provide thoughtful and actionable feedback on why I passed to all founders who I have at least a phone call with.

📪 I'm happy to stay in touch with companies I've passed on; feel free to add me to your update email list.

🤝 Don't ask me to introduce you to other investors if I've passed on your company; it's not a good signal and won't help you.
