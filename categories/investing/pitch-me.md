## How To Pitch Me

----

<br/> 

### Guidelines

My goal with these guidelines is to **save time** for me and you:

* The best way to contact me is **email: athos1 at gmail dot com** 

* I welcome cold emails!  **No need for a warm intro**.

* Don't send me text, LinkedIn, WhatsApp or Twitter messages; **I may not respond**. (And if I do, it will only be to ask that you move the conversation over to email.)

* Send me a brief message along with a **deck or memo**.  No need to ask permission to send a deck.  

* Your message should include the following **baseline info**: what the company does; founder background(s); company stage and traction; how much you're raising; and at what valuation.

* If you have a **secret or special insight** into your market, unique expertise, or intriguing early signals of market pull / product validation, please mention them!

* **I don't sign NDAs**, so please don't ask.

* **I treat founders with respect**, and I ask that you reciprocate.

### Process

I try to reach investment decisions using no more than 2 meetings and 2 weeks of calendar time, with the following steps:  

* You **email me your deck**, including the baseline info specified above.

* I pass, or I send you **3-5 preliminary questions** to gauge if this is a fit.  The goal is to avoid wasting time for either of us.

* We do an **intro meeting**, in which you describe the vision, product, market, company, team, traction, tech, and macro trends (why now?).  

* I pass, or I send you **10-12 deep-dive questions** that examine the business more closely.

* We do a **deep-dive meeting** during which you answer these questions.  (Or you can answer them by email if you prefer).

* I pass, or I commit to invest, and you accept using the [YC handshake protocol](https://www.ycombinator.com/handshake/).

* You send me the **investment docs and wire instructions**; I sign them and wire the funds.

Despite my best efforts, sometimes things slip; if I seem to drop the ball, please send me a nudge.  Also, please send calendar invites with links or locations for all meetings.

### Passing

My philosophy on passing:

* I don't believe in "retaining optionality".  If I don't plan to invest, I will let you know, explicitly.

* I invest in fewer than 1% of the companies I see, so please don't take it personally if I don't invest in yours.

* I try to provide thoughtful and actionable feedback on why I passed to all founders who I have at least a phone call with.

* Sometimes there may be a great company doing everything right that just isn't a fit for me.  

* I'm happy to stay in touch with companies I've passed on; feel free to add me to your update email list.

* Don't ask me to introduce you to other investors if I've passed on your company; it's not a good signal and won't help you.
