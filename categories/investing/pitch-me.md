## How To Pitch Me

----

<br/> 

### Mechanics

*I review lots of companies.  To help me give your company the best chance of success, please follow these guidelines:*

<br/>

📧 **Email is the best way** to contact me.  Don't send me text, linked-in, whatsapp or twitter messages, I may not respond.

🧊 I welcome cold emails!  **No need for a warm intro**.

📝 Send me a brief message along with a **deck or memo**.  No need to ask permission to send a deck.  If you don't or can't send me a deck, I can't invest.

ℹ️ Your message should include the following **baseline info**: 
- *what the company does*
- *founder background(s)*
- *company stage and traction*
- *how much you're raising*
- *valuation and terms*

❗️ Without this info, I will either ignore your email, or respond asking you to fill in the blanks, so please save time for both of us by including this info from the start.

🤐 **I don't sign NDAs**, so please don't ask.

🎲 **I treat founders with respect**, and I ask that you reciprocate.

### Timelines

*I typically reach investment decisions using no more than 2 meetings and 2 weeks of calendar time.  Here is the process I like to follow:*

1️⃣ You **email me your deck**, including the baseline info specified above.

2️⃣ I pass, or I send you **3-5 preliminary questions** to gauge if this is a fit.

3️⃣ We do an **intro meeting**, in which you describe the vision, product, market, company, team, traction, tech, and macro trends (why now?).  

4️⃣ I pass, or I send you **10-12 deep-dive questions**, in which I examine the business more closely.

5️⃣ We do a **deep-dive meeting** during which you answer these questions.  (Or you can answer them by email if you prefer).

6️⃣ I pass, or I commit to invest, and you accept using the [YC handshake protocol](https://www.ycombinator.com/handshake/).

7️⃣ You send me the **investment docs and wire instructions**; I sign them and wire the funds.

### Passing

☹️ I invest in fewer than 1% of the companies I see, so please don't take it personally if your company is not a fit.  

📝 I try to provide thoughtful and actionable feedback on why I passed to all founders who I have at least a phone call with.

📞 I'm happy to stay in touch with companies I've passed on; please feel free to add me to your update email list.

🤝 But please don't ask me to introduce you to other investors if I've passed on your company; it's not a good signal and won't help you.
