## How I Help

----

<br/> 

## 

I can help on almost all operational aspects of early-stage startups. I’m especially strong on:  

📝 **Story-telling:** The ability to craft a compelling narrative -- for customers, for partners, for investors, for employees, for the press -- is an essential part of the founder's toolkit, and it's something I have a lot of experience with.

🌻 **Go-to-market:** A great product won't change the world unless it's matched with great distribution. And modern distribution is complex: inbound, outbound, bottom-up, top-down, product-driven, sales-driven, community-driven, channel-driven, hybrid -- there are so many interacting options. I can help you navigate them.

👩‍💻 **Recruiting and culture:** The team you build is the company you build. To attract and retain and empower and scale a truly world-class team is perhaps the biggest challenge for founders today. Creating a strong culture is the key to solving this challenge, and it's something I pride myself on.

💽 **Data and API strategy**: I know the modern data ecosystem well, and can help on almost every aspect of data in your organization: business and commercial strategy, infrastructure and technical choices, and team construction and growth.
