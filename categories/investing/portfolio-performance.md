## Investing in Public

*In the spirit of "building in public", I thought I'd share annual updates on portfolio performance; what's working and what's not.  This is not investment advice, nor is it an offer or solicitation to buy or sell securities.*

### TLDR

As of Dec 2022, my angel investments have an IRR of 49%.  I've made 29 investments, had 3 exits and 5 failures.  TVPI is x and DPI (the only metric that matters) is Y.

My angel investing career has had several distinct phases.  Combining them into 1 portfolio (per the TLDR above) isn't as informative as breaking them into cohort.




### Cohort 1: 2014 to 2017 -- 8 deals

I made my first "arms-length" angel investment in 2014, while still running Quandl.  Over the next 3 years I made several more angel investments.  These were all small cheques into India-based startups, about half direct and half via syndicate.  I didn't follow any systematic strategy for either dealflow or selection; these were ad hoc investments.  Two notable companie in this cohort are Locus (Tiger, Falcon, GIC) and Mad Street (Sequoia.

### Cohrto 2: 2019 to 2021 -- 12 deals


Between 2019 and 2021 I made a 14 invest,ents.  These were still small cheques, into startups in Canada, the US and Europe.  Still largeyl ad hoc but getting more intentional towards the end.  Companies in tis cohort include Daloopa

(Note that I didn't make any angel investments in 2018; we were busy selling Quandl.)


### Cohort 3: 2022 to present -- 8 deals and counting

Starting in 2022, I became more intentional about angel investing; this coincided with my moving on from Quandl / Nasdaq.  I now have a tighter thesis, portoflio model, and dealflow channels.  I still invest

### Portfolio Notes

🌱 All the above investments were done at what would today (2023) be considered pre-seed stage: very early product with minimal or zero revenue.

<!--🧭 I invest only where I think I have an edge, in either dealflow or evaluation.  As a consequence, my portfolio tends to skew non-Bay Area, mostly B2B, and mostly under-represented or atypical founder profiles.-->

<!--🎯 I invest my own money.  This gives me a very different objective function from many (most?) startup investors.-->

😎 My portfolio companies have gone on to raise further funding from Sequoia, Tiger Global, Falcon Edge, GIC and others.
