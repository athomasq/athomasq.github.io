## My Angel Portfolio

----

<br/>

### Portfolio Notes

🌱 All my investments are at pre-seed stage: very early product with minimal or zero revenue.

🏆 I invest only where I think I have an edge.  Hence my portfolio tends to skew non-Bay Area, mostly B2B with a data angle, and mostly atypical founder profiles.  

💴 I invest my own money.  This gives me a very different objective function from many startup investors.  

<!-- My portfolio companies have gone on to raise further funding from Sequoia, Tiger Global, Falcon Edge, GIC and others. -->
