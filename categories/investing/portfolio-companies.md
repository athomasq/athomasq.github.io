## My Angel Portfolio

----

<br/>

### Portfolio Notes

🌱 All my investments are at pre-seed or seed stage: very early product with minimal or zero revenue.

💴 I invest my own money.  This gives me a very different objective function from many startup investors.  

📈 I share my performance in public; see [portfolio statistics](/portfolio-statistics).

For a more detailed description of these companies and why I invested, [click here](/portfolio-detailed).

In addition to investing directly in startups, I am an LP in and advisor to [GrowX Ventures](http://www.growxventures.com/), who I believe to be India's best seed-stage venture capital firm.  

My portfolio companies have gone on to raise further funding from Sequoia, Tiger Global, Falcon Edge, GIC and others. 

🏆 I invest only where I think I have an edge.  Hence my portfolio tends to skew non-Bay Area, mostly B2B with a data angle, and mostly "outsider" founder profiles.
