## Investing in Public

----

*In the spirit of "building in public", I thought I'd share annual updates on my angel portfolio performance; what's working and what's not.  This is not investment advice, nor is it an offer or solicitation to buy or sell securities.*

### TLDR

As of Dec 2022, my angel investments have an IRR of 49%.  I've made 29 investments, with 3 exits and 5 failures; the remaining 21 companies are "live".

My angel investing career has had several distinct phases.  Combining them into 1 portfolio (per the TLDR above) isn't as informative as breaking them into cohorts.


### Cohort 1: 2014 to 2017 -- 9 companies

I made my first arms-length angel investment in 2014, while running my own startup Quandl.  Over the next 3 years I invested in 8 more companies.  These were all small cheques into India-based startups, about half direct and half via syndicate.  I didn't follow any systematic strategy for selection or portfolio construction; this was a very *ad hoc* portfolio.

Companies: **9**
Cheques: **14**
TVPI: **5.7**
DPI: **3.7**
IRR: **39%**

Key learnings: power law. teams. miss 100% of the dea;s you dnt see. mechanics matter. 


### Cohort 2: 2019 to 2021 -- 14 companies

Between 2019 and 2021 I wrote 22 cheques into 14 companies, while running Quandl post its acquistion by Nasdaq.  These were slightly larger cheques, but with a different geographical focus than cohort 1: Canada, the US and Europe.  These investments were largely *ad hoc* initially, but were getting more intentinoal towards the end.

Companies: **14**
Cheques: **22**
TVPI: **1.7**
DPI: **0.1**
IRR: **41%**

Key learnings: 


### Cohort 3: 2022 to present -- 8 companies and counting

Starting in 2022, I became more intentional about angel investing; this coincided with my moving on from Quandl and Nasdaq.  I now have a tighter thesis, portoflio model, and dealflow channels.  Statistics for this cohort are easy to calculate: no action, hence TVPI is 1, DPI is 0, and IRR is 0%.
