## Investing in Public

----

*In the spirit of "building in public", I thought I'd share annual updates on my angel portfolio performance.  This is not investment advice, nor is it an offer or solicitation to buy or sell securities or anything else.*

---

<br/>

### TLDR

As of Dec 2022, my angel investments have a blended IRR of 49%.  I've invested in 29 companies, with 4 exits and 3 failures thus far.

My angel investing career has had several distinct phases.  Combining them into a single portfolio isn't as informative as breaking them into cohorts, which I do below.  These cohorts analogize nicely to "traditional" venture fund cycles.

### Cohort I: 2014 to 2017 (India)

I made my first arms-length angel investment in 2014, while running my own startup Quandl.  Over the next 3 years I invested in 8 more companies.  These were all small cheques into India-based startups, about half direct and half via syndicate.  I didn't follow any systematic strategy for selection or portfolio construction; this was a very *ad hoc* portfolio.

Companies: **9**  
Cheques: **14**  
TVPI: **5.7**  
DPI: **3.7**  
IRR: **39%**  

**Key learnings:** power law outcomes; team and market above all else; deal mechanics matter.

### Cohort II: 2019 to 2021 (global)

Between 2019 and 2021 I wrote 22 cheques into 14 companies, while running Quandl post its acquistion by Nasdaq.  These were slightly larger cheques, but with a different geographical focus than cohort I: Canada, the US and Europe.  These investments were somewhat *ad hoc* initially, but got more intentional towards the end.

Companies: **14**  
Cheques: **22**  
TVPI: **1.7**  
DPI: **0.1**  
IRR: **41%**  

**Key learnings:** entry price matters; avoid both fomo and value investing; consensus decisions lead to mediocre outcomes.

<br/>

### Cohort III: 2022 to present (global)

Starting in 2022, I became more intentional about angel investing; this coincided with my moving on from Quandl and Nasdaq.  I now have a tighter thesis, portfolio model, and dealflow channels.  

Statistics for this cohort are easy to calculate: no action, hence TVPI is 1, DPI is 0, and IRR is 0%.

**Key learnings:** differentiation matters; tech beats hype; trust your judgement.
