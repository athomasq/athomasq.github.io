## Investment Themes

----

<br/>

Things I think about:
* the implications of the solar learning curve 
* "atom" businesses empowered by "bits"
* breaking up corporations
* deglobalization and fragmentation
* "business of one" -- the opposite of collaboration software
* inverted marketplaces
* deployment age for data
