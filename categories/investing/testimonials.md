## Founder Testimonials

<br/> 

My goal is to be the best angel investor on your cap table.  

But don't just take my word for it.  Here are some testimonials from my portfolio founders:

* *"Abraham is willing and able to provide advice that can be the tipping point for those difficult founder decisions. The nuance and detail that incorporates your unique business situation, the current market, and his own personal experiences is offered with swift confidence, which is **the ultimate secret weapon** for any founder."*

* *"Abraham is **a great investor to work with**. He's highly professional and always available for help. For anyone looking for capital, Abraham is an excellent addition to have on their cap table"*

His **wealth of knowledge** on all aspects of growing a business, especially data businesses, combined with his tactical and on-point advice, has been **instrumental in helping us scale** and achieve success. Whether it's raising capital, strengthening the business model, or executing on a growth strategy, Abraham always has valuable insights to share."*

* *"Abraham has been **our most responsive and helpful investor**. He responds thoughtfully to every update, question and ask that we have, and takes the necessary action to make a positive impact on our business."*

* *"When I have a hard problem, **I call Abraham**. He's experienced the same challenges first hand and survived. He truly puts the time and effort to making sure the founders he works with are successful."*

He's been with us from right at the beginning and has consistently provided **absolutely on-point advice** at each stage, in the most hyper rational way which has been a massive assistance against the extreme highs and lows of running an early stage business. I've not only recommended, but actively encouraged other founders to work with Abraham as he brings **so much more than just an investment**."*
