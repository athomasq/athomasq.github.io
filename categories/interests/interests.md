## What I'm Interested In

----

<br/> 

### Professional 

My professional interests lie at the intersection of **data, markets, and technology**.

**Data:** As a species, we are defined by our ability to manipulate information: language, writing, software. It's not a coincidence that the word we associate most strongly with human evolutionary advantage — intelligence — means both raw data, and the capacity to act on it.

**Markets:** Markets are the most effective and resilient mechanism we have found to solve a hard problem: how should society allocate resources in the face of incomplete information and uncertain outcomes?

**Technology:** Writing, agriculture, government, cities, money, industry: these and other technologies have impacted humanity in profound (and still evolving) ways. We're living through another technological revolution right now: software. And we've barely scratched the surface of what it can achieve.

If you're also interested in these themes, I strongly recommend subscribing to my newsletter, [Pivotal](https://pivotal.substack.com/about).

### Ethical

While I believe in the ability of markets, data and technology to make the world a better place, I'm also keenly aware of their limitations. 

Data can be noisy, messy or incomplete; more dangerously, it can be misleading, biased or falsified.  Not all questions can be answered with data.  High-quality decision-making under uncertainty with imperfect information is hard, and therefore valuable.

Markets can be imperfect, incomplete, non-competitive, regulated, corrupt, captured, rigged or otherwise flawed.  Flawed markets lead to information errors, poor incentives and inequitable outcomes.  

Technology is vulnerable to incompetence, malice, misuse, indifference, bias and unforeseen consequences.  
The optimist (and ex trader) in me says that every inefficiency is an opportunity; the humanist in me cares for the individuals affected by these inefficiencies.  Using data-markets-technology to make the world a truly better place is not easy.
