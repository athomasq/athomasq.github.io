### About This Guide

Most websites and guidebooks try to be *comprehensive* – they have information about every city, every neighbourhood, every sight.  In a country like Japan, this can quickly get overwhelming. 

Not this one.  This is a **curated** guide.  I tell you what to do, and when; where to go, and how.  But also, what *not* to do; which sights are skippable; how to manage your time effectively.  

(I lived in Japan for many years, during which time I travelled extensively all over the country.  And I’ve visited Japan a dozen or so times after I moved away.  This guide is the distillation of all I've learned over more than 25 years as a resident, business visitor, and tourist.) 

Follow my instructions and I promise you, you will have a magnificent vacation.  Enjoy!
