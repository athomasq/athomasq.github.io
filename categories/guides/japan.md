### About This Guide

I lived in Japan for many years, and have visited the country many times.  This is the distillation of all I've learned over 25+ years, as a resident, business visitor, and tourist. 

Most websites and guidebooks try to be *comprehensive* – they have information about every city, every neighbourhood, every sight.  In a country like Japan, this can quickly get overwhelming. 

Not this one.  This is a ***curated*** guide.  I tell you what to do, and when; where to go, and how.  But also, what *not* to do; which sights are skippable; how to manage your time effectively and enjoyably.  Follow my instructions and I promise that you will have a magnificent vacation.

### What This Guide Covers

I have an unusually eclectic set of tastes, that I explored in great depth while living in and visiting Japan.  This guide reflects those tastes and interests:

* Japanese aesthetics and design  
* Buddhist temples and rock gardens   
* Cityscapes, neon lights, nightlife  
* Modern urbanism, transit, liveability  
* Anime, manga, otaku and weeb culture  
* Food, restaurants, stalls and markets  
* Coffee, jazz and photography  
* Paper crafts, fabrics, everyday design  
* Tools, gadgets, electronics, gear  
* Zen philosophy and mindfulness  
* Shinto shrines and respect for nature  
* Balancing old and new, traditional and modern, speed and patience; attention to detail and the aesthetics of little things  
I think the guide does a good job of combining the insider / resident / Japanese speaker perspective, with the foreigner / visitor / tourist perspective.

And finally, I’m an over-optimizer, an enthusiastic researcher and planner, and mildly OCD.  You get to benefit from all those attributes!

### What This Guide Isn’t

This is not an “off-the-beaten-path” guide.  I do include a number of my personal favourite places to go, some of which are obscure.  But I also include many of the more popular destinations: they’re popular for a reason.  That’s the whole point of opinionated curation: I’m picking the spots that will give you the best vacation, well-known or otherwise.

This is not a budget cheapo guide, nor is it a luxury YOLO guide.  Instead, I try to follow a middle ground.  Fortunately, many of the best experiences aren’t expensive, and many of the most expensive experiences aren’t very good.

While I’m an avid photographer, this is not an Instagram-centric guide.  But I’ve included plenty of my own pictures to give you a sense of the places you’ll visit.
