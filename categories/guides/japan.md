### About This Guide

I lived in Japan for many years, and have visited the country many times.  This is the distillation of all I've learned over 25+ years, as a resident, business visitor, and tourist. 

Most websites and guidebooks try to be *comprehensive* – they have information about every city, every neighbourhood, every sight.  In a country like Japan, this can quickly get overwhelming. 

Not this one.  This is a ***curated*** guide.  I tell you what to do, and when; where to go, and how.  But also, what *not* to do; which sights are skippable; how to manage your time effectively and enjoyably.  Follow my instructions and I promise that you will have a magnificent vacation.
