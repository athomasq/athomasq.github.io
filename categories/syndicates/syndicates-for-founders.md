## Syndicates FAQ for Fouders

----

<br/>

**1. What is a startup syndicate?**  

A startup syndicate is a structure where a group of investors pool their money in order to invest in a tech startup.

<br/>

**2. What are the component of a syndicate?**

A syndicate has several pieces:

* A **syndicate lead** who identifies and evaluates startups to invest into; does all the diligence and negotiates terms; coordinates the  capital-raise from other investors; and acts as the point of contact for the founder.

* One or more **syndicate investors** who put their money into the syndicate and get returns.  

* The **investee company** which is the startup that receives money from the syndicate.  

* A **syndicate administrator** who manages all the paperwork, reporting, wire processing, distributions etc. (I use a company called AngelList as my syndicate administrator).  

<br/>

**3. What are the advantages of syndicates?**

Startups like syndicates because it's more convenient than raising money from lots of individual investors.  The syndicate lead does all the work in gathering investors, pitching them (via the deal memo), collecting funds etc.  Syndicates are especially useful when "filling out" a round where there's already a lead investor (typically a VC) in place, though some syndicates are happy to lead rounds themselves. 

Investors like syndicates because they get access to opportunities they wouldn't otherwise get; they benefit from the syndicate lead's network, evaluation and expertise; they can invest small cheques; and they can build a diversified startup portfolio relatively easily.

**4. How does the process work?**

A typical syndicate investment process has the following steps:

1. The syndicate lead **identifies a promising startup** and negotiates investment terms with the founder, including a minimum / maximum allocation.

2. The syndicate lead shares a **deal memo** with the syndicate investors, laying out the case for investment, including a decision deadline and minimum cheque size.  

3. Syndicate members **choose whether or not to participate** in the deal, and if they participate, how much they will invest.

4. Syndicate members **wire their investment amounts** to the administrator.  

5. Once the target allocation has been met and all funds have been received, the **syndicate is closed**.

6. Alternatively, if the allocation is not met, the syndicate is **cancelled**, and funds are returned to the investors.

7. Assuming the target is met, the syndicate lead then connects the startup founder with the syndicate administrator.  The founder shares **wire details**, and also provides some basic corporate information.

8. The administrator sets up a **special purpose vehicle** -- usually, a Delaware LP -- which acts as the investment entity for the syndicate.

9. The administrator sends the funds to the investee company, and the company **issues securities** in the name of the SPV (equity, convertible notes, SAFEs etc).  Note that the SPV is a single line entry on the cap table; founders don't have to deal with individual syndicate investors.

10. Over time, the company either **succeeds or fails**. In the case of a successful exit (an acquisition, IPO, or buyout), the syndicate's shares or notes are bought out or redeemed for cash.  

11. The administrator winds down the SPV and **distributes the proceeds** to all the syndicate members.

<br/>

**5. As a founder, what do I have to do to facilitate the syndicate process?**

You'll have to do the following:

1. Help the syndicate lead craft a pitch for the investor group; review the deal memo for accuracy and completeness; provide data that the lead asks for.

2. Share wire details, company info, and (in some cases) a tax rep letter with the syndicate administrator.

3. Receive and acknowledge funds from the syndicate administrator.  Issue shares or securities in the name of the SPV.

4. Provide business updates to the syndicate lead, at least once a quarter (but preferably monthly).

<br/>

**6. What are the costs associated with syndicate investing?**

Syndicates typically have a setup fee and a success fee.  Both of these costs are paid by the syndicate investors; the startup doesn't pay anything.

* The syndicate administrator charges a fixed one-time **setup fee** -- typically, $8k to $10k -- to handle all legal, tax/accounting, software, compliance and regulatory expenses over the life of the investment.  

* The syndicate lead receives a **success fee**, sometimes known as the "carry" -- typically, 20% of all net profits after fees.

Two things to note here:

* The setup fee is deducted from the investment amount that the company receives.  For example, if the syndicate raises $100k and has $10k in setup fees, the company only receives $90k (and issues $90k worth of securities).

* The success fee is charged on proceeds *after the initial investment and all other fees have been paid back*.  In other words, investors pay either a success fee on winners, or the setup fee, but they don't pay both.
