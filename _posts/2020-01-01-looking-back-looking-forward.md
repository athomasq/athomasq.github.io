# Looking Back, Looking Forward

*It's a good time of year for retrospectives; here's mine.*

Ten years ago, I was very very good at a very very specific skill: quantitative investing for hedge funds.  To be sure, it was a lucrative skill to be good at, and certainly stimulating and interesting on a day-to-day basis.  But on a year-to-year basis, it was stultifying.  I felt I was just solving elaborate puzzles to make some already-wealthy people marginally better off, and others marginally worse off: not what I wanted to do with my life.

And so I quit, took some time off, and eventually co-founded Quandl with my friend Tammer.  We spent most of the decade building the company, and every year brought different challenges:

- Year 0 was **Idea**: what's a problem worth solving?
- Year 1 was **Technology**: is the problem solvable?
- Year 2 was **Product**: will people use our solution?
- Year 3 was **Monetization**: will they pay for it?
- Year 4 was **Marketing**: how do we reach them?
- Year 5 was **Sales**: how do we close them? 
- Year 6 was **Scale**: how do we expand?
- Year 7 was **Strategy**: how do we win over the long term?

And of course every year was about team-building and culture-building and company-building; the foundations that made meeting all these other challenges possible.

Of course this sounds very neat and tidy in retrospect.  At the time it was anything but!  We muddled along, making large numbers of (thankfully non-fatal) mistakes: two steps forward, one step back, three and a half steps sideways, and then perhaps half a step forward again.  We had to revisit our original idea; we had to rebuild our technology; we had to change our GTM motion.  We learned so much along the way.  I wouldn't change our experience for anything!  

(And not just because, unlike most startup stories, ours had a [happy](https://www.nasdaq.com/about/press-center/nasdaq-acquires-quandl-advance-use-alternative-data) [ending](https://www.waterstechnology.com/awards-rankings/4351881/acquisition-of-the-year-nasdaqs-acquisition-of-quandl)).  

It's been a decade of tremendous growth for me: intellectual, personal, and professional.  If I were to wish for one thing for the next decade, it's that I get to learn and grow even half as much.  Here's to the 2020s!
