# Looking Back, Looking Forward

*It's a good time of year for retrospectives; here's mine.*

Ten years ago, I was very very good at a very very specific skill: quantitative investing for hedge funds.  To be sure, it was a lucrative skill to be good at, and certainly stimulating and interesting on a day-to-day basis.  But on a year-to-year basis, it was stultifying.  I felt I was just solving elaborate puzzles that made some alread-wealthy people marginally better off, and others marginally worse off: not what I wanted to do with my life.

And so I quit, took some time off, and eventually co-founded Quandl with my friend Tammer.  We spent most of the decade building and growing Quandl: we incorporated the company in May 2011 (after several months of prototype-hacking), and ultimate sold the company to Nasdaq in December 2018. 

What strikes me looking back is how little we knew about building technology startups, and how much we learned along the way.  



If I'm grateful for one thing about the decade that just ended, it's this broadening of my professional and intellectual horizons.  






 Every year at Quandl brought different challenges:

- Year 0 was about the **idea**: what problem do we want to solve, and why does it matter?
- Year 1 was about **technology**: can we even solve this problem we've identified?  
- Year 2 was about converting technology into **product**: if we build it, will people use it?  
- Year 3 was about **monetization**: sure people will use it if it's free, but will they pay for it?  
- Year 4 was about **marketing**: we've found a few people who will use and pay for our product, how do we reach more of them?  
- Year 5 was about **sales**: how do we get individuals and institutions to pay us more over time?  
- Year 6 was about **scale**: how do 
- Year 7 was about **strategy**: 

And of course every year was about team-building and culture-building and company-building.

Of course this sounds very neat and tidy in retrospect.  At the time it was anything but! 

We felt we were muddling along.

It was also highly non-linear.  We had to revisit our idea; we had to rebuild our technology; we had to change our gtm motion.  


Fund-raising tends to follow these milestones.

idea, technology, product, revenue, growth, scale, strategic

self-funded, friends & family, pre-seed, seed, A, B, C


I wouldn't change it for anything!  It's been a decade of tremendous intellectual growth.

So I thought I'd share. 


It's been a decade full of intellectual growth.

It's a good time of year for retrospectives.  






It's the time of year when social media is awash with retrospectives of the decade that just ended.  I look

It wasn't easy.  When Tammer and I started Quandl, we knew almost nothing.  


At the beginning of the decade, I was an expert in an exceedingly narrow field: quantitative investing.

One of the most stimulating (read: demanding) aspects of taking a startup from inception to acquisition is that every year brings different challenges.  For Quandl, these challenges followed roughly this path:  

- Year 0 was Idea: what's a problem worth solving?
- Year 1 was Technology: is the problem solvable?
- Year 2 was Product: will people use it?
- Year 3 is Monetization: will they pay for it?
- Year 4 was Marketing: how do we reach them?
- Year 5 was Sales: how do we close them? 
- Year 6 was Scale: how do we expand?




Every year at Quandl brough different challenges.



also a decade of personal growth, but that;s a story for a different blog post.
