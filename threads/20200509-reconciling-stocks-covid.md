1/ Revisiting this question from last month. How do you reconcile unprecedented economic stress -- small businesses wiped out, record unemployment -- with the S&P 500 being down just 13% from its all time high?  Sharing a few notes from thoughtful observers: 

2/ @SuperMugatu summarizes the fundamental case: Fiscal policy has bridged the unemployment cash shock. States are ready to reopen. Capital markets remain functional. Earnings are strong. Some firms may fail, but the system as a whole is fine.  https://medium.com/@dan_60967/devils-advocate-the-bull-case-338718cf177c

3/ @Doctorow has a more cynical view: The virus disproportionately affects the poor and small biz. The economy as a whole is driven by the wealthy and big biz. Reopening is happening, and it will hurt the former, but it will benefit the latter, and so stocks are up. https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1258782598374912011

4/ @Calvinfo reminds us of the fallacy of composition: Looking at just the index can be misleading. Individual stocks appear fairly priced. Energy, consumer, financial stocks are mostly down; tech and tech infrastructure stocks are mostly up. This all makes sense! https://twitter.com/calvinfo/status/1254635755671969793

5/ Paul Tudor Jones makes a denominator argument: "We are witnessing the Great Monetary Inflation (GMI) â€” an unprecedented expansion of every form of money unlike anything the developed world has ever seen ... The result has been asset price reflation." https://www.docdroid.net/H1fuimX/the-great-monetary-inflation-pdf

6/ My own opinion: the truth is some mixture of all the above, plus the possibility that the market is simply wrong: remaining irrational while bearish investors scramble to stay solvent.

7/ Sooner or later, convergence is inevitable.  Either the market will move downwards to match current perceptions of the economy, or our perceptions will adjust upwards and we'll realize the market was right all along.  Either way, we live in interesting times!
