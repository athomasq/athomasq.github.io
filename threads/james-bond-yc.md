0/ The more I think about it, the more perturbed I am that Y-Combinator's "ideal" co-founder is James Bond (http://startupclass.samaltman.com/courses/lec02)

3/ And people wonder why Silicon Valley is so full of entitled, blinkered, arrogant, self-important, socially-disconnected douchebags.

4/ Founders who act this way are just fulfilling the roles that investors and advisors like YC subconsciously (or consciously) encourage.

5/ You could argue the "white male" part is incidental and YC is really talking about resourcefulness and resilience. No. That's a cop-out.

6/ There are other models of resourceful resilience. Many are underdogs and outsiders. Most are worthier of emulation than James Bond.

7/ Selecting Bond is the ideal co-founder is an incredibly strong implicit bias. It's revealing and also very dismissive.

8/ Bond is *not* a role model for women, immigrants, introverts, the modest, strategic doers, feminists, minorities and many others.

9/ If you want to be contrarian and right, hire "anti-Bonds". They are clearly undervalued in today's talent market.
